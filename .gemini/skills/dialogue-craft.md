# Dialogue Craft

## Core Principles

### Character Voice
Each character should have a distinctive voice based on:
- **Vocabulary** - Education, background, profession
- **Rhythm** - Short/long sentences, interruptions
- **Syntax** - Formal/informal, complete/fragmented
- **Idioms** - Regional, cultural, generational

### Subtext
What characters mean vs. what they say:
- Characters rarely say exactly what they mean
- Conflict between text and subtext creates tension
- Actions can contradict words
- Silences speak volumes

## Techniques

### Exposition Through Conflict
Bad:
```fountain
SARAH
I'm your sister who you haven't seen in five years since mom's funeral.
```

Good:
```fountain
SARAH
Five years and you couldn't even call?

MIKE
I was at the funeral.

SARAH
For an hour. Then you vanished.
```

### Oblique Dialogue
Characters talk around the real issue:
```fountain
SARAH
How's the apartment?

MIKE
It's fine.

SARAH
Just fine?

MIKE
What do you want me to say?
```
(They're really discussing their relationship, not the apartment)

### Interruptions and Overlaps
```fountain
SARAH
I think we should—

MIKE
—talk about this later?
```

### Silence and Pauses
```fountain
SARAH
Did you love her?

Mike doesn't answer. His silence says everything.
```

## Voice Differentiation

| Character | Vocabulary | Rhythm | Traits |
|-----------|------------|--------|--------|
| Professor | Academic | Measured | Complete sentences |
| Teen | Slang | Fast | Fragments |
| Soldier | Direct | Clipped | Commands |
| Poet | Imagery | Flowing | Metaphor |

## Common Pitfalls

- **On-the-nose dialogue** - Characters stating feelings directly
- **Expository lumps** - Information dumps
- **Generic voice** - All characters sound the same
- **Name overuse** - "Well, Sarah, I think..."
- **Redundant dialogue** - Saying what action shows

## Best Practices

1. Read dialogue aloud
2. Cover character names—can you tell who's speaking?
3. Cut anything that doesn't reveal character or advance plot
4. Use silence and action as dialogue
5. Let subtext do the heavy lifting
