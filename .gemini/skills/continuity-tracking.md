# Continuity Tracking

## Continuity Types

### Timeline Continuity
- Day/night consistency
- Elapsed time accuracy
- Date references
- Seasonal details
- Age progression

### Spatial Continuity
- Character locations
- Geography consistency
- Travel times
- Room layouts
- Building relationships

### Character State
- Physical condition (injuries, fatigue)
- Emotional state progression
- Knowledge (what they know when)
- Relationships evolution
- Wardrobe consistency

### Object Continuity
- Props (where are they?)
- Vehicles (damage, location)
- Documents/items (who has what)
- Technology (phones, weapons)

## Tracking Methods

### Scene-by-Scene Log
| Scene | Time | Location | Characters | Key States |
|-------|------|----------|------------|------------|
| 1 | Day 1, morning | Office | Sarah, Mike | Sarah: healthy, unaware |
| 2 | Day 1, noon | Cafe | Sarah, Amy | Sarah: suspicious |
| 3 | Day 1, evening | Apartment | Sarah | Sarah: injured, angry |

### Character Timeline
```

- Scene 1: At work, normal day
- Scene 3: Learns about conspiracy
- Scene 7: Injured in car chase (left arm)
- Scene 12: Still has arm injury (verify!)

```

### Object Registry
```
THE ENVELOPE:
- Scene 5: Received by Mike

## Common Errors

### Timeline Errors

- Impossible geography
- Inconsistent layouts

### State Errors
- Forgotten injuries
- Impossible knowledge
- Costume changes without explanation
- Emotional jumps
