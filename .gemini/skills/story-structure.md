# Story Structure

## Three-Act Structure

### Act One (Setup) - ~25%
- **Opening Image** - Visual that sets tone
- **Theme Stated** - Hint at the theme
- **Setup** - Introduce protagonist, world, stakes
- **Catalyst** - Inciting incident
- **Debate** - Protagonist hesitates
- **Break into Two** - Protagonist commits to journey

### Act Two (Confrontation) - ~50%
- **B Story** - Secondary storyline (often romance/friendship)
- **Fun and Games** - Promise of the premise
- **Midpoint** - False victory or defeat, raises stakes
- **Bad Guys Close In** - Pressure increases
- **All Is Lost** - Lowest point
- **Dark Night of the Soul** - Protagonist confronts failure

### Act Three (Resolution) - ~25%
- **Break into Three** - Solution discovered
- **Finale** - Confrontation and resolution
- **Final Image** - Opposite of opening, showing change
