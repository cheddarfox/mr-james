# Fountain Syntax

## Overview
Fountain is a plain text markup language for writing screenplays. Files use the `.fountain` extension.

## Core Elements

### Scene Headings
```fountain
INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY
EXT. CITY STREET - NIGHT
INT./EXT. CAR (MOVING) - CONTINUOUS
```

Must begin with `INT`, `EXT`, or `INT./EXT.` followed by location and time of day.

### Action
Plain paragraphs become action/description:
```fountain
Sarah enters the crowded coffee shop, scanning the room. She spots MIKE at a corner table.
```

### Character Names
Character names in ALL CAPS on their own line:
```fountain
SARAH
Hello, Mike. It's been a while.
```

### Dialogue
Follows character name, indented automatically:
```fountain
MIKE
(surprised)
Sarah? I didn't expect to see you here.
```

### Parentheticals
Direction within dialogue, in parentheses:
```fountain
SARAH
(sitting down)
We need to talk.
```

### Transitions
End with `TO:` or force with `>`:
```fountain
CUT TO:

> FADE OUT.
```

### Dual Dialogue
Use `^` for simultaneous speech:
```fountain
SARAH
I can't believe you—

MIKE ^
Let me explain—
```
