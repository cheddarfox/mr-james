## [1.4.0] - 2026-01-11

### Added

- **Capability Validation Script** (`scripts/validate-capabilities.js`)
  - Validates all 24 skills and 30 commands against compliance checklist
  - Hard errors for: missing frontmatter, name mismatch, invalid wtfbId, invalid YAML
  - Warnings for: missing "Use when:", description length, imperative voice
  - Supports `--mode=template|marketplace` for hub/spoke reuse
  - New npm script: `npm run validate:capabilities`

- **PR Validation Workflow** (`.github/workflows/pr-validation.yml`)
  - Enforces PR title format: `type(scope): description`
  - API-only (no checkout, no fork code execution)
  - Minimal permissions for security

- **Spoke Author Contract Documentation**
  - Third-party plugin namespace rules in CAPABILITY_CONTRACT.md
  - Multi-marketplace coexistence guide in PLUGIN_ARCHITECTURE.md
  - Hub vs spoke contribution rules in CONTRIBUTING.md

- **Claude Code Installation Instructions**
  - Added to QUICKSTART.md prerequisites
  - Added to README.md Quick Start section

### Changed

- **validate.yml**: Added `validate-capabilities` job
- **PR Template**: Added skill/command compliance checklist
- **CLAUDE.md**: Added CI/CD section with validation commands
- **AGENTS.md**: Added Agent Contributions to CI section
- **CONTRIBUTING.md**: Added PR title format and capability validation docs
- **package.json**: Updated validate script to include capability check

### OSS-Friendly Design

- PR title validation: hard error (blocks merge)
- Commit message validation: skipped (maintainers squash-merge)
- Rebase enforcement: skipped (reduces contributor friction)
- Subjective checks (imperative voice, description length): warnings only

## [1.3.0] - 2026-01-11

### Added

- **Hub-Spoke Plugin Architecture**: Infinitely extensible ecosystem design
  - Template is the hub (complete 11-agent harness, free, OSS)
  - Plugins are spokes that extend capabilities (free or paid)

- **Capability Contract Specification**: Technical standard for plugin extensibility
  - `wtfbId` canonical identifiers for all capabilities
  - `provides`, `extends`, `replaces` relationship types
  - `requires`, `compat` compatibility gates
  - Selection policy for deterministic capability resolution

- **Documentation Suite** in `docs/guides/`:
  - `CAPABILITY_CONTRACT.md` - Technical spec for plugin authors
  - `PLUGIN_ARCHITECTURE.md` - How plugins extend the template
  - `USER_ACCESS_TIERS.md` - Access levels (Community, Pro, Internal)
  - `TEMPLATE_MARKETPLACE_RELATIONSHIP.md` - Ecosystem overview

- **Plugin Precedence Control**: `.wtfb/project.json` now supports `plugins.precedence` array

### Changed

- All 24 skills now include `wtfbId: wtfb:{name}` metadata for registry identity
- `.claude/README.md` updated with namespace conventions and capability identification
- `README.md` updated with:
  - Hub-spoke architecture documentation
  - Plugin creation guide (free and paid)
  - WTFB community journey (tools → courses → publishing → production)
  - Plugin development guides in documentation table

### Breaking Changes

For marketplace plugin authors:

- Skills in marketplace plugins **MUST** declare `wtfbId`
- Skills **MUST** declare exactly one of: `provides`, `extends`, or `replaces`
- The `wtfb:` namespace is reserved for template capabilities

### Migration Guide

For existing plugins:

1. Add `wtfbId: {your-plugin}:{skill-name}` to all skill frontmatter
2. Add relationship type (`provides`, `extends`, or `replaces`) to declare intent
3. Add `compat.template` version range for compatibility checking
