## Arc Integrity Checklist

For each character arc, verify:

### Continuity
- [ ] Arc begins clearly in Act One
- [ ] Arc progresses through Act Two
- [ ] Arc completes in Act Three
- [ ] No unexplained gaps in development
- [ ] Character doesn't disappear mid-story

### Causality
- [ ] Each change is caused by story events
- [ ] Character reacts appropriately to events
- [ ] Changes feel earned, not arbitrary
- [ ] Transformation is visible in behavior

### Completion
- [ ] Starting and ending states contrast
- [ ] The journey feels complete
- [ ] Loose ends are resolved
- [ ] Arc serves the theme

## Finding Arc Holes

| Question | Answer | Fix Required? |
|----------|--------|---------------|
| Does the character vanish for long stretches? | | |
| Are there unexplained behavior changes? | | |
| Does the arc plateau without progress? | | |
| Is the transformation rushed at the end? | | |
| Is the starting state clear enough? | | |
| Is the ending state satisfying? | | |

## Story Thread Tracking

Beyond character arcs, track all story threads:

| Thread | Introduction | Development Points | Resolution |
|--------|--------------|-------------------|------------|
| A Story (Main) | | | |
| B Story (Subplot) | | | |
| C Story (Subplot) | | | |
| Romance | | | |
| Mystery | | | |
| Theme | | | |

### Thread Convergence

How do threads come together in the climax?

| Thread | How It Connects to Climax |
