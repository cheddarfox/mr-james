## Project Type Variations

Templates work across project types with minor adaptations:

| Template | Screenplay | Novel | Film Production |
|----------|------------|-------|-----------------|
| Beat Sheet | Scene-based | Chapter-based | Production schedule |
| Character Registry | Full use | Full use | Casting reference |
| Treatment | Industry format | Query/synopsis | Pitch deck |
| Continuity | Script supervision | Editor's notes | Production tracking |

## How Templates Are Used by AI

When you invoke commands like `/writers-room` or `/story-check`, the AI references these templates:

1. **Structure validation**: Compares your work against beat-sheet.md
2. **Character consistency**: Checks against character-registry.md
3. **Pitch preparation**: Uses treatment-template.md format
4. **Continuity checking**: Follows continuity-report.md patterns

## Customizing Templates

Templates are starting points. Customize them for your project:

1. **Copy, don't modify originals**: Keep templates/ clean for reference
2. **Add project-specific sections**: Include what you need
3. **Remove unused sections**: Don't carry dead weight
4. **Maintain structure**: AI commands expect certain sections

**Example customization:**
```bash
# Copy to docs for customization
cp templates/beat-sheet.md docs/my-beat-sheet.md

# Edit for your project
# Add/remove beats as needed
```

## Template Sync

Templates are in `syncPaths` in project.json, meaning they CAN be updated from the upstream WTFB template. This keeps your templates current with best practices.

If you've customized templates, keep your working copies in `docs/` (which is protected).

## Adding Custom Templates

To add a project-specific template:

1. Create the file in `templates/`
2. Follow the existing format patterns
3. Include clear section headers
4. Add usage instructions at the top
5. Update this README

**Template conventions:**
- Use Markdown format
- Include YAML-like metadata section
- Use tables for structured data
- Include placeholder text in brackets: `[YOUR TEXT HERE]`

## Best Practices

1. **Fill templates early**: Structure helps creativity
2. **Update continuously**: Living documents, not one-time forms
3. **Use for validation**: Check your work against templates
4. **Share with collaborators**: Common reference point
5. **Version your filled templates**: Track in git with your project
