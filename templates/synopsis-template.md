## COMMON SYNOPSIS MISTAKES

### Avoid:
- **Too much plot**: Focus on essential beats only
- **Too many characters**: Protagonist, antagonist, 1-2 key supporting
- **Cliffhanger ending**: Always reveal how it ends
- **Play-by-play**: Don't describe every scene
- **Passive voice**: Keep it active and dynamic
- **Questions instead of answers**: Tell the story, don't tease

### Remember:
- A synopsis is NOT a teaser trailer
- Readers need to know the ENDING
- Focus on emotional journey, not just events
- Every sentence must earn its place
