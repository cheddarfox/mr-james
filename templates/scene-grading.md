## Identify Your Best Scene

**Your A+ Scene:** [Scene Name/Number]

### Why It Works

| Element | How This Scene Excels |
|---------|----------------------|
| Opening | |
| Conflict | |

### Apply These Qualities

For each C/D/F scene, ask:

- How can I make the character moments as revealing?
- How can I make the ending as powerful?

- [ ] Enter the scene as late as possible
- [ ] Exit the scene as early as possible
- [ ] No unnecessary greetings/goodbyes
- [ ] No small talk that doesn't serve character
- [ ] Every line of dialogue earns its place
- [ ] Every action line is necessary
- [ ] White space is appropriate for pacing
