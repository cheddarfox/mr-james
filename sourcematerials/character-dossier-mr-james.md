## The Origin of "The Work"

Mr. James didn't receive magic - he inherited a burden.

His grandmother Eliza Tolliver was born enslaved in 1848. She was what they called a "two-headed woman" - someone who could see what shouldn't be seen, move what shouldn't move. Her people called it "the work" - not magic, but *work*, because it cost you.

Eliza passed it to her daughter Mae, who passed it to James when he was twelve, on the night a white mob came for their neighbor. Mae held James's face between her hands and pushed something into him - something that burned, saw, knew. She died three days later, used up. Her last words: "It don't give. It trades."

## What the Work Is

The work is not supernatural power - it is **debt carried forward**.

**What he can do:**
- See consequences (not the future - the *weight* of actions)
- Know when something's wrong with a person, place, or situation
- Open doors that shouldn't open (literal and metaphorical)
- Pass the work on (the most dangerous thing)

**What it costs:**
- Each use takes time off his life
- He cannot hold onto joy - it slips through him
- He is physically unable to lie
- He will die alone. The work ensures it.

## The Wound

**He had a son. The son is dead. It is his fault.**

In 1945, James came home from the war to his wife Delilah and their son Marcus. By 1955, Marcus was thirteen and already showing signs of the work.

When a white shopkeeper accused Marcus of whistling at his wife - three months after Emmett Till - James knew what was coming. The work screamed it at him. But he had spent ten years refusing the work, and in that moment, he couldn't reach it. Or he could, and he was afraid of what reaching for it would cost.

Marcus died. James will never know if he failed to save his son or *chose* not to.

Delilah left. She died in Cleveland in 1971. James learned from a letter two weeks after the funeral.

## Want vs. Need

**Want:** To pass the work on before he dies - to someone who will use it right, who won't make his mistakes.

**Need:** To forgive himself for Marcus. To accept that he was afraid, that he is human. To believe that the children's love isn't just obligation - that someone can love *him*, not just what he carries.

## Why These Three Children

The work chooses. But James understands:

1. Each child is marked by loss - the work gravitates toward wounds
2. Together they form something complete: One sees (like him). One speaks (what he cannot). One does (what he's afraid to do)
3. They are not his redemption - they are his final test: *Can you love again knowing you might fail them?*

## His Arc

**Act One:** Isolated, guarded, carrying sixty years of service and loss. "I failed once. I will not fail again. But I will not get close enough to feel it if I do."

**Act Two:** Opens despite himself. The children ask questions he stopped asking. At midpoint, he reacts with fury when a child does something reckless - sees Marcus in that moment. First crack.

**Act Three:** Must choose: protect himself or sacrifice for the children. He chooses them. This is not a heroic death - it is a *release*. He admits: "I was afraid. I'm still afraid. But I'm not going to let that stop me this time."

The work passes to the three children freely, without fear, without conditions.

## Voice

- Never says "magic" - says "the work," "what we carry," "the knowing"
- Speaks in truths that sound like riddles
- Answers questions with questions until he trusts you
- When direct, it's startling - short sentences, no metaphor
- Rarely uses contractions - formality as distance

**Sample Dialogue:**
> "Magic ain't something you hold onto. It's something you become. And becoming? That takes summers."

> "I had a son. I did not save him. I have spent forty years asking myself why. I still do not have an answer I can live with. But I am going to save you. Not because I have to. Because I *want* to."

## What He Leaves Behind (2019)

- Letters for each of them, to be opened "when you're ready"
- For the one who sees: his grandmother's cracked mirror
- For the one who speaks: his mother's Bible with her handwriting
- For the one who does: his pocket watch, stopped at 3:47

**His final message:**
> "I didn't save you because you were special. You became special because someone loved you. Now it's your turn."
