## Story Concept

Every child gets to go on an adventure for one summer (while their parent is working).

**20 years later** — they all get a text that Mr. James needs them.

They come together for one last adventure. But this one is **for Mr. James**.

He takes them on one last quest where he then **passes on the magic to the next generation** — to guide children to their destinies and be brave, honest, and good citizens.

> "Watch out for minos."

He tells them the story of how he came into possession of the magic to pass on to the next generation.

## Story Architect Notes

### Core Elements Identified

1. **Dual Timeline Structure** — Childhood summers (past) + Adult reunion (present)
2. **Mentor Figure** — Mr. James as guide/guardian with magical responsibility
3. **Legacy Theme** — Passing the torch to a new generation
4. **Three Protagonists** — 2 boys, 1 girl, each from different family situations
5. **Mystery Element** — "Watch out for minos" (Minotaur? Minions? TBD)
6. **Quest Structure** — Final adventure with stakes for the mentor

### Thematic Threads

- **Found family** — Children from broken homes finding connection
- **Coming of age** — Both childhood adventures and adult reckoning
- **Legacy and responsibility** — What we pass on to the next generation
- **Magic as metaphor** — For wonder, guidance, purpose

### Questions for Development

- What is the nature of Mr. James's magic?
- What were the original summer adventures like?
- Why does Mr. James need them now? Is he dying? In danger?
- What are "minos" — a threat? A test? A creature?
- How does each character's family situation shape their arc?
