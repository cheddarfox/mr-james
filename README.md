## What if AI worked like a real creative team?

When you're making a movie, you don't ask one person to write the script, direct, handle the budget, design costumes, AND edit the final cut. You hire a team of specialists who each bring their expertise to the table.

**That's exactly what we built for AI.**

Instead of asking one AI to do everything, we created a system where multiple AI specialists work together—each with their own job, their own expertise, and their own responsibilities.

---

## The Problem

When you ask ChatGPT or Claude to help write a screenplay, you get... fine results. But here's what's missing:

- **No structure** — It doesn't know when to check formatting vs. when to focus on story
- **No specialization** — It's a generalist pretending to be an expert
- **No teamwork** — There's no one to catch mistakes or offer a different perspective
- **No standards** — Every session starts from scratch

It's like hiring one intern to do everything instead of building a real team.

---

## The Solution: An 11-Person AI Team

This template gives you a complete creative team:

| Team Member | What They Do |
|-------------|--------------|
| **Story Architect** | Makes sure your story structure works (can veto bad structural changes) |
| **Dialogue Writer** | Gives each character a unique voice |
| **Scene Writer** | Describes action and visuals |
| **Continuity Editor** | Catches timeline mistakes and contradictions |
| **Script Supervisor** | Ensures proper screenplay format (must approve before export) |
| **Research Specialist** | Checks facts and accuracy |
| **Story Analyst** | Scene-by-scene quality analysis |
| **Standards Reviewer** | Industry best practices |
| **Production Coordinator** | Handles exports and delivery |
| **Session Manager** | Coordinates workflow |
| **Scene Annotator** | Organizes notes and development |

Each one knows their job. Each one has expertise. And they work together.

---

## How It Works

### Like a Hollywood Writers' Room

In Hollywood, writers' rooms have structure:

1. **The showrunner** has final say on story direction
2. **Senior writers** can push back on bad ideas
3. **Staff writers** pitch and draft scenes
4. **The script coordinator** makes sure everything's formatted right

Our AI team works the same way.

### Some Team Members Can Say "Stop"

Not everyone on the team is equal. Some have special authority:

- **The Story Architect** can veto changes that break the story structure
- **The Script Supervisor** must approve formatting before anything is final

This prevents the AI from making mistakes that would slip through a single-AI system.

### They Share Knowledge

All team members have access to:

- **Industry patterns** — How professional screenplays are structured
- **Best practices** — What works in dialogue, scene construction, etc.
- **Your project history** — What's happened so far in your story

They're not starting from zero. They know the craft.

---

## Works With Multiple AI Platforms

We're not locked to one AI:

| Platform | Status |
|----------|--------|
| **Claude Code** (Anthropic) | Full support |
| **Gemini CLI** (Google) | Full support |
| **OpenAI Codex** | Documented |

Same team structure. Different AI underneath.

---

## Quick Start

> **New to WTFB?** See the full [QUICKSTART Guide](docs/QUICKSTART.md) for step-by-step instructions with screenshots and troubleshooting.

### 1. Install Claude Code

```bash
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code
claude auth  # Authenticate with your Anthropic API key
```

### 2. Create Your Project

```bash
# From GitHub template
gh repo create my-screenplay --template bybren-llc/wtfb-projects-template --clone --public
cd my-screenplay

# Initialize (interactive prompts)
./scripts/init-project.sh
npm install
```

### 3. Install the AI Team Plugin

```bash
claude  # Start Claude Code in your project
/plugin install wtfb-screenwriting@github.com/bybren-llc/wtfb-claude-marketplace/plugins/screenwriting
```

### 4. Start Writing

```bash
/start-scene Opening confrontation in the bar
```

Your AI team is now active. The Story Architect will ensure structure. The Dialogue Writer will refine voices. The Script Supervisor will catch formatting issues. They work together automatically.

## Why WTFB? (Competitive Analysis)

We did the research. Here's how WTFB compares to alternatives:

| vs. Competition | WTFB Advantage |
|-----------------|----------------|
| **vs. Final Draft / Movie Magic** | They have no AI. We have 11 specialized agents. |
| **vs. AI Writing Tools** | They're single AI. We're multi-agent with authority controls. |
| **vs. CrewAI / AutoGen** | They're general-purpose. We have 24 craft skill modules. |
| **vs. All of Them** | We're open source, extensible, and export to industry formats. |

**Unique to WTFB:**

- Tiered authority system (veto/gate powers)
- Enterprise self-hosting with private workflows
- Community marketplace for custom tools
- Fountain format: open, portable, AI-friendly
- VS Code Live Share for real-time collaboration

## Global CLI

Use our tools across any project:

```bash
npm install -g @wtfb/cli
```

```bash
wtfb validate       # Validate Fountain, Markdown, spelling
wtfb export-pdf     # Export to industry-standard PDF
wtfb export-fdx     # Export to Final Draft XML
wtfb export-html    # Export to HTML preview
```

See [@wtfb/cli on npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@wtfb/cli) for full documentation.

---

## Beyond Screenwriting

The same pattern works for any field that needs expert collaboration:

| Screenwriting | Software Development | Legal | Medical Research |
|---------------|---------------------|-------|------------------|
| Story Architect | System Architect | Senior Partner | Principal Investigator |
| Dialogue Writer | Frontend Developer | Contract Specialist | Literature Reviewer |
| Scene Writer | Backend Developer | Compliance Officer | Biostatistician |
| Script Supervisor | QA Tester | Research Associate | Ethics Liaison |

We've already built a [software development harness](https://github.com/bybren-llc/wtfb-claude-marketplace/tree/main/plugins/software-dev). The architecture is universal.

---

## The WTFB Ecosystem

WTFB uses a **hub-spoke architecture** that's infinitely extensible:

- **Hub**: This template — complete 11-agent writing harness (free, OSS)
- **Spokes**: Plugins that extend capabilities (free or paid)

```
              ┌──────────────────┐
              │  wtfb-projects-  │
              │    template      │
              │   (The Hub)      │
              │  11 agents       │
              │  24 skills       │
              │  30 commands     │
              └────────┬─────────┘
                       │
       ┌───────────────┼───────────────┐
       │               │               │
       ▼               ▼               ▼
  ┌─────────┐    ┌─────────┐    ┌─────────┐
  │  Your   │    │  WTFB   │    │Community│
  │ Plugin  │    │ Premium │    │ Plugins │
  │ (Free)  │    │ (Paid)  │    │ (Free)  │
  └─────────┘    └─────────┘    └─────────┘
```

**The hub is complete by itself.** You can write, validate, and export without any plugins. But if you want more — specialized workflows, enhanced skills, professional tools — plugins extend the foundation.

---

## Creating Your Own Plugins

Anyone can extend WTFB. The architecture is open.

### Free Plugins (Contribute to Community)
