```

### HTML (exports/html/)

**Characteristics:**
- Responsive design
- Readable on any device
- Shareable via link (when hosted)
- Quick preview without PDF reader

**Generated by:**
```bash
/export-html                   # Via AI command
```

## Gitignore Configuration

Generated files are gitignored by default to keep the repository clean:

```gitignore
# From .gitignore
exports/pdf/*.pdf
exports/fdx/*.fdx
exports/html/*.html
```

**Why gitignore exports:**
- They can be regenerated from source
- Large binary files bloat repository
- Source (Fountain/Markdown) is the canonical version

**To include exports in git:**
Remove the lines from `.gitignore` or use `git add -f exports/pdf/my-screenplay.pdf`

## File Naming Convention

Exports should follow a consistent naming pattern:

```
[project-name]-[version]-[date].[ext]

Examples:
racoon-rescue-v2-2026-01-08.pdf
racoon-rescue-draft-1.fdx
racoon-rescue-preview.html
```

**Version indicators:**
- `draft-1`, `draft-2`: Working drafts
- `v1`, `v2`: Major versions
- `final`: Production-ready
- `submission`: For specific submission

## Export Workflow

### Standard Export Flow

1. **Validate first:**
   ```bash
   npm run validate
   /check-format
   ```

2. **Generate exports:**
   ```bash
   /export-all              # All formats
   /export-pdf              # PDF only
   ```

3. **Review exports:**
   - Open PDF and check formatting
   - Verify page count
   - Check scene numbers
   - Confirm title page

4. **Rename with version:**
   ```bash
   mv exports/pdf/screenplay.pdf exports/pdf/my-project-v2-final.pdf
   ```

### Production Export Flow

For production use, generate comprehensive package:

```bash
/export-all                   # Generate all formats
/check-continuity             # Verify no continuity issues
```

Production package should include:
- `exports/pdf/[name]-production.pdf` - Numbered, dated
- `exports/fdx/[name]-production.fdx` - For Final Draft users
- `templates/continuity-report.md` - Filled out
- `templates/character-registry.md` - Complete

## Export Tools

### Fountain to PDF

The screenwriting plugin uses fountain-js or afterwriting for PDF generation:

```javascript
// Typical conversion flow
fountain.parse(script) → screenplay object → PDF renderer → file
```

**PDF options (when available):**
- Scene numbers: left, right, both, none
- Title page: include or exclude
- Page size: US Letter, A4
- Margins: standard screenplay margins

### Fountain to FDX

FDX export creates Final Draft-compatible XML:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<FinalDraft DocumentType="Script" Version="1">
  <Content>
    <Paragraph Type="Scene Heading">
      <Text>INT. LOCATION - DAY</Text>
    </Paragraph>
    ...
  </Content>
</FinalDraft>
```

### Fountain to HTML

HTML export creates styled web pages:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <style>/* Screenplay CSS */</style>
</head>
<body class="screenplay">
  <div class="scene-heading">INT. LOCATION - DAY</div>
  ...
</body>
</html>
```

## Novel Exports

For novel projects, exports work differently:

| Format | Use |
|--------|-----|
| PDF | Print-ready manuscript |
| EPUB | E-reader format |
| DOCX | Word document for editors |
| HTML | Web preview |

## Quality Checklist

Before sharing exports:

- [ ] Validated source file (`npm run validate`)
- [ ] Correct title page information
- [ ] Page count is reasonable
- [ ] No formatting artifacts
- [ ] Scene numbers correct (if applicable)
- [ ] Character names consistent
- [ ] No orphan/widow lines (if PDF)

## Troubleshooting

**PDF looks wrong:**
- Check Fountain syntax with `/check-format`
- Verify scene headings use correct format
- Check for unclosed parentheticals

**FDX won't open in Final Draft:**
- Validate XML syntax
- Check for special characters that need escaping
- Ensure UTF-8 encoding

**HTML missing styles:**
- Check that CSS is embedded or linked
- Verify HTML structure is valid

## Integration with CI/CD

The `deploy-pages.yml` workflow can automatically generate and deploy HTML exports:

```yaml
# In workflow
- name: Generate HTML export
  run: npm run export:html

- name: Deploy to Pages
  uses: actions/deploy-pages@v4
```
