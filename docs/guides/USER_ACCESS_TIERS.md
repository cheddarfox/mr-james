## Plugin Precedence

When you have both template and marketplace capabilities, precedence determines which is used:

```json
{
  "plugins": {
    "installed": ["wtfb-screenwriting"],
    "precedence": ["wtfb-screenwriting"]
  }
}
```

**Rules**:
- Template loads first (foundation)
- Plugins load in precedence order
- `extends` capabilities: both available, premium preferred
- `replaces` capabilities: premium supersedes base

See [Plugin Architecture](./PLUGIN_ARCHITECTURE.md) for details.
