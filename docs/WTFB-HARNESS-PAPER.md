# How We Built an AI Team That Actually Works Together

**A Plain-English Guide to the WTFB Multi-AI Harness**

---

## The Big Idea

Imagine you're making a movie. You wouldn't ask one person to write the script, direct, handle the budget, design costumes, AND edit the final cut. You'd hire a team of specialists who each bring their expertise to the table.

That's exactly what we built for AI.

Instead of asking one AI to do everything, we created a system where **multiple AI specialists work together**, each with their own job, their own expertise, and their own responsibilities.

We call it the **WTFB Harness**.

## Why Does This Matter?

### The Problem With Today's AI

When you ask ChatGPT or Claude to help write a screenplay, you get... fine results. But here's what's missing:

- **No structure** — It doesn't know when to check formatting vs. when to focus on story
- **No specialization** — It's a generalist pretending to be an expert
- **No teamwork** — There's no one to catch mistakes or offer a different perspective
- **No standards** — Every session starts from scratch

It's like hiring one intern to do everything instead of building a real team.

### Our Solution: AI Teams

We built a system where you get an **11-person AI team** working on your project:

| Team Member | What They Do |
|-------------|--------------|
| **Story Architect** | Makes sure your story structure works |
| **Dialogue Writer** | Gives each character a unique voice |
| **Scene Writer** | Describes action and visuals |
| **Continuity Editor** | Catches timeline mistakes |
| **Script Supervisor** | Ensures proper screenplay format |
| **Research Specialist** | Checks facts and accuracy |
| ...and more | |

Each one knows their job. Each one has expertise. And they work together.

## How It Actually Works

### Think of It Like a Writers' Room

In Hollywood, writers' rooms have structure:

1. **The showrunner** has final say on story direction
2. **Senior writers** can push back on bad ideas
3. **Staff writers** pitch and draft scenes
4. **The script coordinator** makes sure everything's formatted right

Our AI team works the same way.

### Some Team Members Can Say "Stop"

Not everyone on the team is equal. Some have special authority:

- **The Story Architect** can veto changes that break the story structure
- **The Script Supervisor** must approve formatting before anything is final

This prevents the AI from making mistakes that would slip through a single-AI system.

### They Share Knowledge

All team members have access to:

- **Industry patterns** — How professional screenplays are structured
- **Best practices** — What works in dialogue, scene construction, etc.
- **Your project history** — What's happened so far in your story

They're not starting from zero. They know the craft.

## The Cool Part: It Works for Anything

Here's where it gets interesting.

We built this for screenwriting, but the same system works for **any type of work** that needs expert collaboration.

### Example: Software Development

We already built a version for software teams:

| Screenwriting Team | Software Team |
|-------------------|---------------|
| Story Architect | System Architect |
| Dialogue Writer | Frontend Developer |
| Scene Writer | Backend Developer |
| Script Supervisor | QA Tester |
| Continuity Editor | DevOps Engineer |

Same idea. Different experts.

### Example: Legal Work

Imagine an AI legal team:

| Role | Job |
|------|-----|
| Senior Partner | Overall strategy |
| Contract Specialist | Reviews agreement terms |
| Compliance Officer | Checks regulations |
| Research Associate | Finds relevant case law |

### Example: Medical Research

Or a research team:

| Role | Job |
|------|-----|
| Principal Investigator | Research direction |
| Biostatistician | Analyzes the numbers |
| Literature Reviewer | Knows what's been published |
| Ethics Liaison | Ensures proper protocols |

**The pattern is universal.** Define the experts. Give them knowledge. Let them collaborate.

## What Makes This Different

### 1. It's Not Just Prompts

Most "AI solutions" are just clever prompts. Ours is an **architecture**:

- Defined roles with clear responsibilities
- Knowledge bases that persist across sessions
- Workflows that ensure quality
- Authority levels that prevent mistakes

### 2. It Works Across AI Platforms

We're not locked to one AI:

- Works with **Claude** (Anthropic)
- Works with **Gemini** (Google)
- Works with **Codex** (OpenAI)

Same team structure. Different AI underneath.

### 3. It's Open Source

Everything is public:

- The templates
- The team configurations
- The knowledge bases
- The workflows

Anyone can use it. Anyone can improve it. Anyone can adapt it to their field.

## Real-World Results

### Screenwriting

We've used this system to develop multiple screenplays:

- **Consistent formatting** — Every scene follows industry standards
- **Structural integrity** — Stories that actually work
- **Distinct voices** — Characters who sound like themselves
- **Continuity** — No timeline errors or contradictions

### Software Development

Our software harness has been used for production applications:

- **Code review** built into the process
- **Security checks** from a dedicated agent
- **Documentation** that stays current
- **Testing** that catches issues early

## Getting Started

### For Writers

```
1. Clone our template
2. Install the screenwriting harness
3. Start writing with your AI team
```

### For Developers

Same thing, different harness:

```
1. Clone our template
2. Install the software harness
3. Start building with your AI team
```

### For Other Industries

Want to build a harness for your field?

1. Identify the experts you need
2. Define what each one knows
3. Set up who has authority over what
4. Create the common workflows

We've documented exactly how to do this:

- **Agent structure**: See [AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md) for team organization
- **Harness architecture**: See [.claude/](./.claude/) and [.gemini/](./.gemini/) directories
- **Plugin creation**: See the [marketplace repository](https://github.com/bybren-llc/wtfb-claude-marketplace)
- **Skills & patterns**: See [patterns/](../patterns/) for examples

## The Vision

We believe AI should work the way **human teams** work:

- **Specialists** who know their domain deeply
- **Collaboration** where different perspectives improve the work
- **Quality control** where mistakes get caught
- **Standards** that ensure consistency

That's not science fiction. That's what we built.

And it's ready for you to use today.
