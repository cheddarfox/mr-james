## Format Specifications

### Fountain (Screenplays)

## Key Principles

1. **Preserve voice** - Maintain the project's established style
2. **Validate first** - Check format before committing
3. **Branch appropriately** - Use `scene/`, `chapter/`, or `revision/` branches
4. **Document changes** - Clear commit messages
5. **Respect protected paths** - Don't modify files in `protectedPaths`
