# Scene Patterns

## Confrontation Scene

### When to Use
- Major character conflicts
- Revelation moments
- Relationship-changing encounters

### Structure
1. **Setup**: Characters in position, tension present
2. **Escalation**: Conflict builds through dialogue
3. **Turn**: New information or power shift
4. **Resolution**: Changed relationship status

### Example
```fountain
INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY

SARAH sits waiting. Checks her watch. JOHN arrives, late.

JOHN
Sorry, traffic was--

SARAH
Sit down.

He sits. A beat.

SARAH (CONT'D)
I know about the account.

JOHN
What account?

SARAH
(sliding paper across)
The one in the Caymans. The one you
opened a week before you proposed.

John stares at the paper. Doesn't touch it.

JOHN
(quiet)
I can explain.

SARAH
Can you?

Long pause.

JOHN
No. I can't.
```

### Variations
- **Public confrontation**: Stakes raised by witnesses
- **Interrupted confrontation**: Cut before resolution
- **Misdirected confrontation**: Wrong target initially

## Discovery Scene

### When to Use
- Protagonist finds key information
- Revelations that change understanding
- Investigation payoffs

### Structure
1. **Approach**: Character nearing discovery
2. **Discovery**: The moment of finding
3. **Reaction**: Physical/emotional response
4. **Implication**: What this means

### Example
```fountain
INT. FATHER'S STUDY - NIGHT

Sarah searches desk drawers. Nothing.

She pauses. Looks at the bookshelf.

One book is slightly out of place.

She pulls it. A CLICK. The shelf swings open.

Inside: A wall of photographs. Documents. A map.

Sarah's hand covers her mouth.

SARAH
(whispered)
My god.

On the map, red circles. One around their house.
```

## Action Sequence

### When to Use
- Physical conflict
- Chase scenes
- Stunts and spectacle

### Structure
- Short paragraphs
- Strong verbs
- White space for pacing
- Beat-by-beat choreography

EXT. ROOFTOP - NIGHT

Sarah RUNS.

Behind her, FOOTSTEPS.

She reaches the edge. Looks down. Six stories.

Looks back. Three FIGURES emerge from the shadows.

No choice.

She JUMPS--

--lands on the next building--

--rolls--

--keeps running.
```
