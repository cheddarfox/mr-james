  This skill provides scene-by-scene analysis techniques for screenplays.
  Covers scene anatomy, beat breakdown, pacing evaluation, and the core
  question "what changes?" to identify unnecessary or weak scenes.

  Use when: analyzing scene effectiveness, evaluating scene pacing,
  identifying scene problems, or breaking down scene beats.

# Scene Analysis Skill

## Invocation Triggers
Apply this skill when:
- Analyzing scene effectiveness
- Evaluating scene pacing
- Identifying scene problems
- Breaking down scene beats

## Scene Fundamentals

### What Makes a Scene?
A scene is a unit of story with:
- Single location (or continuous movement)
- Continuous time (or clearly marked passage)
- Beginning, middle, end
- Purpose in the larger story

### The Scene Question
Every scene should answer:
**"What changes?"**

If nothing changes, the scene may not be necessary.

## Scene Anatomy

### Scene Structure
```
HOOK      → Grabs attention, establishes context
BUILD     → Develops conflict/tension
TURN      → Something changes
RESOLUTION → Scene's immediate outcome
PROPULSION → Sets up what's next
```

### Example Analysis
```fountain
INT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT

HOOK: Sarah sits waiting. Checks her watch. John arrives, late.

BUILD: Awkward pleasantries. Sarah's cool. John tries to connect.

TURN: Sarah reveals she knows about the affair.

RESOLUTION: John admits it. Offers no excuse.

PROPULSION: Sarah says "I want a divorce" - cut before John responds.
```

## Scene Purpose

### Plot Functions
| Function | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Setup** | Establish information for later |
| **Confrontation** | Characters in conflict |
| **Revelation** | New information emerges |
| **Decision** | Character makes choice |
| **Action** | Physical events unfold |
| **Consequence** | Results of previous actions |

### Character Functions
| Function | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Introduction** | Meet a character |
| **Development** | Deepen understanding |
| **Arc moment** | Character changes |
| **Relationship** | Define/change relationship |

### Every Scene Must
1. Serve at least ONE plot function
2. Serve at least ONE character function
3. Ideally serve BOTH simultaneously

## Pacing Analysis

### Scene Length Guidelines
| Type | Pages | Purpose |
|------|-------|---------|
| Short (1/2-1 page) | Quick information, transitions |
| Medium (2-3 pages) | Standard dialogue scenes |
| Long (4-5 pages) | Major confrontations, setpieces |
| Extended (5+ pages) | Climactic moments only |

### Pacing Rhythm
Vary scene lengths for rhythm:
```
SHORT - MEDIUM - MEDIUM - SHORT - LONG - SHORT
```

Not:
```
MEDIUM - MEDIUM - MEDIUM - MEDIUM - MEDIUM
```

### Scene Economy
- **Enter late:** Skip arrivals, greetings
- **Leave early:** Cut after the point is made
- **Cut the fat:** Every line earns its place

## Scene Beats

### What is a Beat?
A shift in the scene - emotion, power, information.

### Identifying Beats
Mark where something changes:
```
1. Sarah waits (anticipation)
   [BEAT: John arrives late]
2. Awkward greeting (tension)
   [BEAT: Sarah asks direct question]
3. John deflects (avoidance)
   [BEAT: Sarah reveals she knows]
4. John exposed (power shift)
   [BEAT: John admits truth]
5. Resolution (new status quo)
```

### Beat Mapping
```markdown
| Beat # | What Happens | Emotional Shift |
|--------|--------------|-----------------|
| 1 | Sarah waits | Hope → Doubt |
| 2 | John arrives | Doubt → Tension |
| 3 | Small talk | Tension → Impatience |
| 4 | Sarah confronts | Impatience → Anger |
| 5 | John admits | Anger → Devastation |
```

## Common Scene Problems

### No Conflict
**Problem:** Characters agree, nothing is at stake.
**Fix:** Give characters opposing goals. Even allies disagree on methods.

### No Change
**Problem:** Scene ends same as it started.
**Fix:** Something must be different. Information, relationship, stakes.

### Wrong Length
**Problem:** Scene overstays welcome or rushes through.
**Fix:** Match length to importance. Trim fat or expand key moments.

### Unclear Purpose
**Problem:** Scene exists but why?
**Fix:** Define the scene's job. If it has none, cut it.

### Predictable
**Problem:** Scene goes exactly as expected.
**Fix:** Add reversals, surprises, complications.

## Scene Types Analysis

### Exposition Scene
- **Risk:** Information dump
- **Goal:** Information + conflict
- **Test:** Would scene be interesting without info?

### Action Scene
- **Risk:** All spectacle, no stakes
- **Goal:** Character revealed through action
- **Test:** What does action tell us about character?

### Dialogue Scene
- **Risk:** Talking heads
- **Goal:** Subtext, conflict, change
- **Test:** Is there tension in the conversation?

### Transition Scene
- **Risk:** Unnecessary
- **Goal:** Essential bridge only
- **Test:** Can it be cut? Can info be combined elsewhere?

## Scene Checklist

### Before Writing
- [ ] What is the scene's purpose?
- [ ] What changes by the end?
- [ ] What's the conflict?
- [ ] When does the scene start/end?

### After Writing
- [ ] Does the scene have a clear hook?
- [ ] Does tension build?
- [ ] Is there a turn?
- [ ] Does it propel to next scene?
- [ ] Can it be shorter?
- [ ] Is it the right length for its importance?
