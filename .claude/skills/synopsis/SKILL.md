# Synopsis Skill

## Invocation Triggers
Apply this skill when:
- Preparing submission materials
- Creating one-page story summaries
- Pitching to producers or executives
- Condensing screenplay for coverage

## What Makes a Good Synopsis

Per WTFB methodology, a good synopsis must:

1. **Be easily pitchable by a producer to others** - They need to be able to sell it up the chain
2. **Be instantly understandable on first read** - No re-reading required
3. **Give an accurate picture of the story** - No misleading or incomplete information
4. **Be one page or less** - Industry standard maximum length
5. **Not over-complicate with every character/detail** - Focus on essentials

## Synopsis vs. Treatment

| Synopsis | Treatment |
|----------|-----------|
| One page maximum | 3-15 pages typical |
| Essential plot only | Detailed scene breakdown |
| Main characters only | All significant characters |
| Present tense | Present tense |
| No dialogue | May include key dialogue |
| Quick read | Longer investment |

## Example Synopsis: Eastern Market

```
TITLE: EASTERN MARKET
GENRE: Human Condition
LOCALE: Detroit
CIRCA: Present Day

LOGLINE:
Two brothers struggle not to waste their lives without wasting each
other at a place called the Eastern Market.

SYNOPSIS:
Eastern Market is the story of two brothers Dino & Angelo Napolitano
who live and work in the once bustling metropolis called Detroit,
that's now become an empty dying city. Similar to the city's
condition, Dino was also once a rising star, who had garnered the
adoration of thousands of boxing fans. When sports broadcasters
bring Dino's name up before a match, it's only in the negative
regarding his squandered talent. He is known as the boxing world's
poster child of self-inflicted failure. Unlike other stories about
failed fighters, there is no chance that Dino could ever return to
the ring. Dino is a keep to himself hard working guy; however, his
hard drinking has only nurtured the bitterness that's consuming his
life and everything around him. Failed at love and life, Dino
doesn't see the woman (Robin) who loves him, only the woman (Kim)
that he lost.

Dino's younger brother Angelo is married with a child and is the
binding force in Dino's life. Every time Dino fails or falls, Angelo
is there to fix things and make it right. But Angelo and his wife
are getting sick and tired of helping his brother and alcoholic
mother Irene at every turn. Angelo just wants to get on with his own
life, but can't let go of his brother.

Both men work for a scumbag named Paul at Backos meats who's been
using the brothers for years. Though it doesn't seem like it, both
men really want the same thing; to make their mark on this life
without leaving a stain, at the place called the Eastern Market.

## Synopsis Writing Tips

### DO
- Write in present tense
- Focus on the protagonist's journey
- Include the ending (unlike a query letter)
- Use active, vivid language
- Convey the tone/genre of the script
- Make it emotionally engaging

### DON'T
- Include every subplot
- Name every character (3-4 max)
- Use dialogue unless essential
- Describe scenes in detail
- Leave the ending ambiguous
- Exceed one page

## Simplicity Test

Ask yourself: "Could even an idiot read it and understand it?"

If you need to re-read sections, simplify. The producer needs to pitch this story to others in a meeting. Make it memorable and clear.

## Synopsis Length Guidelines

```
Standard: 250-350 words (one page, single-spaced)
Short: 150-200 words (half page)
Extended: 500-750 words (two pages - only if requested)
```

## Validation Checklist

- [ ] One page or less
