  This skill provides logline (hook) writing techniques for screenplays.
  Covers the four components (characters, conflict, setting, action),
  formulas for effective loglines, and common mistakes to avoid.

  Use when: distilling a story to its essential hook, preparing pitch
  materials, testing if a concept is compelling, or marketing a screenplay.

# Logline Skill

## Invocation Triggers
Apply this skill when:
- Distilling a story to its essential hook
- Preparing pitch materials
- Testing if a concept is clear and compelling
- Marketing a screenplay

## What is a Logline?

A logline (also called a "hook") is a one to two sentence description of your movie that captures the essence of the story in a way that makes people want to see it.

## The Four Components of a Hook

Per WTFB methodology, every effective hook contains these four elements:

### 1. Characters
- Who are they?
- What do they want?
- What are their goals?

### 2. Conflict
- What is the main obstacle to achieving their goal?
- Who or what opposes them?

### 3. Setting
- Time period
- Genre
- Style/tone

### 4. Action
- What exciting things happen?
- **Never be boring!**

## Logline Formula

```
[ADJECTIVE] [PROTAGONIST TYPE] must [GOAL/ACTION]
when [INCITING INCIDENT/CONFLICT],
or else [STAKES].
```

### Alternative Formula
```
When [SETUP], a [PROTAGONIST] must [OBJECTIVE]
before [ANTAGONIST] [THREAT].
```

### Genre-Specific Formula
```
A [GENRE] about [PROTAGONIST] who [SITUATION]
until [CATALYST] forces them to [ACTION]
against [ANTAGONIST/OBSTACLE].
```

## Classic Logline Examples

### Raiders of the Lost Ark
"An archeologist is hired by the U.S. government to find the Ark of the Covenant before the Nazis."

**Breakdown**:
- Character: Archeologist (implies adventure, intelligence)
- Conflict: Race against Nazis
- Setting: Implied WWII era, adventure genre
- Action: "Find" + competing with Nazis = excitement

### Gladiator
"A Roman general is betrayed and his family killed by an insane emperor. Now a gladiator, he comes to Rome for revenge."

**Breakdown**:
- Character: Roman general (status, skill)
- Conflict: Betrayal, loss, revenge against emperor
- Setting: Roman era, epic drama
- Action: Gladiator combat, revenge journey

## Logline Development Worksheet

### Step 1: Core Elements
```
PROTAGONIST: ___________________________________
(Be specific: not "a man" but "a disgraced surgeon")

GOAL: ___________________________________
(What do they actively pursue?)

ANTAGONIST/OBSTACLE: ___________________________________
(Person, force, or circumstance opposing them)

STAKES: ___________________________________
(What happens if they fail?)

UNIQUE ELEMENT: ___________________________________
(What makes THIS story different?)
```

### Step 2: Draft Loglines

**Draft 1** (Basic):
```
___________________________________________________
___________________________________________________
```

**Draft 2** (Add specificity):
```
___________________________________________________
___________________________________________________
```

**Draft 3** (Add stakes):
```
___________________________________________________
___________________________________________________
```

**Final Logline**:
```
___________________________________________________
___________________________________________________
```

## Logline Quality Checklist

### Must Have
- [ ] Protagonist clearly identified
- [ ] Goal/objective stated
- [ ] Conflict/obstacle present
- [ ] Implies genre
- [ ] One to two sentences maximum
- [ ] Creates desire to know more

### Should Have
- [ ] Unique hook or twist
- [ ] Stakes implied or stated
- [ ] Active voice (character DOES something)
- [ ] Specific rather than vague

### Must Avoid
- [ ] No questions ("What if...?")
- [ ] No character names (unless famous)
- [ ] No theme statements
- [ ] No backstory
- [ ] No "and then" chains

## Common Logline Mistakes

| Mistake | Example | Fix |
|---------|---------|-----|
| Too vague | "A man faces challenges" | "A retired hitman hunts the men who killed his dog" |
| Too long | Multiple sentences | Cut to one powerful sentence |
| No conflict | "A woman discovers her past" | "A woman must confront the cult that raised her" |
| Passive | "A story about love" | "A dying man races to reconnect with his estranged daughter" |
| Lists events | "First X, then Y, then Z" | Focus on central conflict |
| Theme not story | "An exploration of grief" | "A widow must solve her husband's murder" |

## Genre-Specific Tips

### Action/Thriller
- Emphasize physical stakes and ticking clock
- "Must stop X before Y happens"

### Comedy
- Hint at the comedic situation or irony
- Include the fish-out-of-water element

### Drama
- Focus on internal conflict made external
- Emphasize emotional stakes

### Horror
- Establish the threat
- Imply isolation or helplessness

### Romance
- Show the obstacle to love
- Include what makes this couple unique

## Logline Testing

Share your logline and ask:
1. Do they understand the genre?
2. Do they know who the protagonist is?
3. Can they identify the conflict?
4. Do they want to know what happens?
5. Can they picture the movie?

If "no" to any, revise.

- [ ] Conflict/obstacle is compelling
