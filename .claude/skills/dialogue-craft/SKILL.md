# Dialogue Craft Skill

## Invocation Triggers
Apply this skill when:
- Polishing dialogue
- Developing subtext
- Differentiating character voices
- Handling exposition

## Dialogue Principles

### The Purpose of Dialogue
Every line should:
1. **Reveal character** - How they speak shows who they are
2. **Advance plot** - Move the story forward
3. **Create conflict** - Tension between characters
4. **Entertain** - Be engaging to read/watch

Ideally, each line does 2-3 of these simultaneously.

## Subtext

### What is Subtext?
The meaning beneath the words. Characters rarely say exactly what they mean.

### Surface vs. Subtext
```fountain
// Surface level only (BAD)
JOHN
I'm angry at you for lying to me.

// With subtext (GOOD)
JOHN
(quiet)
The coffee's cold.
```

### Creating Subtext

**Displacement:** Talk about something else entirely
```fountain
SARAH
Did you feed the cat?

JOHN
You know I always forget.

// They're talking about how he always lets her down
```

**Deflection:** Avoid the real subject
```fountain
SARAH
We need to talk about last night.

JOHN
Have you seen my keys?
```

**Contradiction:** Say the opposite of truth
```fountain
SARAH
Are you okay?

JOHN
Never better.

He won't meet her eyes.
```

**Indirection:** Circle around the point
```fountain
SARAH
I saw the ring in your drawer.

JOHN
It was my mother's.

SARAH
It's beautiful.

JOHN
She would have liked you.

// Neither mentions the proposal
```

## Voice Differentiation

### Elements of Voice
| Element | Range |
|---------|-------|
| Vocabulary | Simple ↔ Complex |
| Sentence length | Short ↔ Long |
| Formality | Casual ↔ Formal |
| Directness | Blunt ↔ Indirect |
| Humor | Dry ↔ Broad |
| Emotion | Reserved ↔ Expressive |

### Voice by Background
- **Education:** Vocabulary complexity, grammar
- **Region:** Slang, rhythm, expressions
- **Profession:** Jargon, verbal habits
- **Age:** Generational references, formality
- **Personality:** Introvert vs. extrovert patterns

### Example: Three Characters, Same Information
```fountain
// Academic
PROFESSOR
The statistical probability of survival decreases
exponentially beyond the 72-hour threshold.

// Street
MARCUS
Three days, man. After that? You ain't coming back.

// Military
COMMANDER
Window's 72 hours. Then we write them off.
```

## Handling Exposition

### The Problem
Audiences need information, but "info dumps" kill scenes.

### Exposition Techniques

**Conflict:** Characters argue about the information
```fountain
JOHN
The company's been laundering money for years.

SARAH
That's insane. My father built this company.

JOHN
Then he built it on dirty money.
```

**Discovery:** Character learns with audience
```fountain
Sarah finds the document. Her eyes scan it.

SARAH
(reading)
"Project Nightfall. Initiated 1985..."
(looks up)
This goes back forty years.
```

**Need to Know:** Character explains to someone who needs it
```fountain
VETERAN
You're new. First rule: Never go below deck 5.

ROOKIE
Why? What's down there?

VETERAN
That's rule two. Don't ask.
```

**Conflict of Interest:** Information becomes ammunition
```fountain
SARAH
I know about the money, John.

JOHN
(carefully)
What money?

SARAH
The hundred thousand in the offshore account.
The one you opened the week before you proposed.
```

### What to Avoid
- Characters telling each other what they both know
- "As you know, Bob..." constructions
- Long explanatory monologues
- Information that doesn't serve a scene purpose

## Dialogue Rhythm

### Varying Line Length
```fountain
SARAH
I loved you.

JOHN
I know.

SARAH
I would have done anything for you. Given up
everything. My career, my family, my future.
Everything.

JOHN
I know.
```

### Beat and Pause
```fountain
SARAH
I found the letters.

(beat)

JOHN
I can explain.

SARAH
Can you?

Long silence.

JOHN
No.
```

### Overlapping Dialogue
Indicated by `--` for interruption:
```fountain
SARAH
I just think we should--

JOHN
--Not now.

SARAH
But if we could just--

JOHN
I said not now.
```

## Common Dialogue Problems

### On the Nose
Characters stating emotions directly.
```fountain
// BAD
SARAH
I feel betrayed and hurt by your actions.

// BETTER
SARAH
(sliding off ring)
Here. I won't be needing this.
```

### Greeting Rituals
Unnecessary pleasantries.
```fountain
// BAD
JOHN
Hello, Sarah. How are you?

SARAH
I'm fine, thanks. And you?

JOHN
Good, good. Thanks for meeting me.

// BETTER
JOHN
(seated, waiting)
You're late.

SARAH
(sitting)
You're lucky I came at all.
```

### Identical Voices
All characters sound the same.

Test: Cover character names. Can you tell who's speaking?

### Speechifying
Characters make speeches instead of conversation.

Break long speeches with:
- Interruptions
- Action beats
- Other character reactions
- Internal contradiction

## Dialogue Polish Checklist

### Per Line
- [ ] Could this be cut? (If yes, cut it)
- [ ] Does it reveal character?
- [ ] Does it advance plot?
- [ ] Is there subtext?
- [ ] Is it speakable?

### Per Scene
- [ ] Is there conflict in the conversation?
- [ ] Do voices sound distinct?
- [ ] Is exposition earned?
- [ ] Are there moments of silence?
- [ ] Does rhythm vary?

### Per Script
- [ ] Can characters be identified by voice alone?
- [ ] Is subtext consistent per character?
- [ ] Are relationships clear through dialogue?
- [ ] Does dialogue evolve as characters do?
