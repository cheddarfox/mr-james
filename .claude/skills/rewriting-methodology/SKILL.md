# Rewriting Methodology Skill

## Invocation Triggers
Apply this skill when:
- Beginning the rewrite process
- Identifying weak scenes
- Improving overall script quality
- Preparing for final polish

## The WTFB Rewriting Philosophy

Rewriting is where screenplays are truly made. The first draft gets the story down; rewrites make it work.

### The Industrious Attitude
Approach rewriting with an industrious attitude. Don't be precious about your first draft. Be willing to cut, change, and improve ruthlessly.

## The 6-Step Rewriting Process

### Step 1: Identify the Stories
Ask "What are the stories?" - List sentences starting with "The story of..."

```markdown
THE STORY OF...
1. ___________________________________
2. ___________________________________
3. ___________________________________
4. ___________________________________
5. ___________________________________
```

Each story thread needs a complete arc. If you can't articulate it simply, it may be unclear in the script.

### Step 2: Chart the Arcs

Create a chart tracking each story thread across the acts:

```markdown
| Story Thread | Beginning | Act One | Act Two | Act Three | Finish |
|--------------|-----------|---------|---------|-----------|--------|
| Main Plot | | | | | |
| B-Story | | | | | |
| Character Arc | | | | | |
| Subplot 1 | | | | | |
| Subplot 2 | | | | | |
```

### Step 3: Find the HOLES

Look at your chart. Identify:
- Missing story beats (empty cells)
- Threads that disappear
- Arcs that don't complete
- Inconsistencies between threads

```markdown
## HOLES IDENTIFIED
1. ___________________________________
   Location: ___________
   Solution: ___________

2. ___________________________________
   Location: ___________
   Solution: ___________

3. ___________________________________
   Location: ___________
   Solution: ___________
```

### Step 4: Grade Your Scenes

Go through every scene and grade it: A, B, C, D, F

```markdown
## SCENE GRADING

| Scene # | Location | Grade | Notes |
|---------|----------|-------|-------|
| 1 | | | |
| 2 | | | |
| 3 | | | |
| ... | | | |
```

**Grading Criteria**:
- **A**: Essential, well-executed, couldn't be better
- **B**: Good, serves story, minor improvements possible
- **C**: Adequate, but needs work
- **D**: Weak, may not be necessary
- **F**: Fails to serve the story, cut or completely rewrite

### Step 5: Elevate to Your Best

**Make every scene as good as your best scene.**

This is the core principle. Find your best scene (the A+ scene). Analyze why it works. Apply those qualities to every other scene.

For each scene below an A:
```markdown
Scene #___: Current Grade: ___

What my best scene has that this lacks:
1. ___________________________________
2. ___________________________________
3. ___________________________________

Specific improvements:
1. ___________________________________
2. ___________________________________
3. ___________________________________
```

### Step 6: Compression

**Compression is artful - shorten everything.**

- Enter scenes later
- Exit scenes earlier
- Cut dialogue to its essence
- Remove redundant action lines
- Combine characters where possible
- Eliminate scenes that don't advance plot or character

```markdown
## COMPRESSION TARGETS

Scenes to cut entirely:
- Scene ___: Reason: _______________
- Scene ___: Reason: _______________

Scenes to shorten:
- Scene ___: Remove: _______________
- Scene ___: Remove: _______________

Dialogue to trim:
- Page ___: Cut: _______________
- Page ___: Cut: _______________
```

## Scene Grading Rubric

### A Scene Criteria
- [ ] Essential to plot or character arc
- [ ] Conflict is active and immediate
- [ ] Characters want something
- [ ] Scene has a turning point
- [ ] Dialogue is subtext-rich
- [ ] Visual storytelling is strong
- [ ] Enters late, exits early
- [ ] Advances story significantly

### B Scene Criteria
- [ ] Necessary for story understanding
- [ ] Has conflict or tension
- [ ] Characters are active
- [ ] Could be slightly tightened
- [ ] Serves a clear purpose

### C Scene Criteria
- [ ] Purpose is unclear
- [ ] Conflict is weak or absent
- [ ] Could be combined with another scene
- [ ] Exposition-heavy
- [ ] Doesn't quite work

### D Scene Criteria
- [ ] Questionable necessity
- [ ] Little to no conflict
- [ ] Characters are passive
- [ ] Mostly setup with no payoff
- [ ] Drags the pace

### F Scene Criteria
- [ ] No clear purpose
- [ ] No conflict
- [ ] Could be cut without losing anything
- [ ] Redundant to other scenes
- [ ] Actively hurts the story

## Rewrite Priorities

After grading, address in this order:

1. **Structural holes** - Fix missing story beats
2. **F scenes** - Cut or completely reimagine
3. **D scenes** - Combine, cut, or reinvent
4. **C scenes** - Strengthen or combine
5. **B scenes** - Polish and tighten
6. **A scenes** - Minor polish only

## Compression Techniques

### Dialogue Compression
- Cut greetings/small talk
- Remove "on the nose" dialogue
- Start mid-conversation
- End before conversation ends
- Let subtext carry meaning

### Scene Compression
- Start with conflict already happening
- Cut reaction beats (audience provides them)
- Remove transitions
- Combine locations
- Time jump when possible

### Character Compression
- Combine similar function characters
- Remove characters who don't drive plot
- Give one character another's key moments

## Validation Checklist

- [ ] Listed all story threads
- [ ] Charted arcs across acts
- [ ] Identified all holes
- [ ] Graded every scene
- [ ] Identified best scene qualities
- [ ] Applied best scene qualities throughout
- [ ] Compressed dialogue and scenes
- [ ] Cut or fixed F and D scenes
- [ ] Script is tighter than previous draft
