  This skill provides character arc development frameworks and techniques.
  Covers the core arc formula (flaw to strength, want to need, lie to truth),
  positive change arcs, negative arcs, and supporting character development.

  Use when: developing character transformations, tracking character growth,
  analyzing protagonist journeys, or building supporting character arcs.

# Character Arcs Skill

## Invocation Triggers
Apply this skill when:
- Developing character transformations
- Tracking character growth
- Analyzing protagonist journey
- Building supporting character arcs

## Arc Fundamentals

### What is a Character Arc?
The internal transformation a character undergoes, usually from:
- Flaw → Strength
- Want → Need
- Lie → Truth
- Fear → Courage

### The Core Arc Formula
```
CHARACTER starts BELIEVING [lie/flaw]
EVENTS force CHARACTER to confront [truth]
CHARACTER transforms by EMBRACING [new understanding]
```

## Arc Types

### Positive Change Arc
Character overcomes flaw, grows positively.
```
Start: Believes the lie
Middle: Confronted by truth
End: Embraces truth, transformed
```
Example: Scrooge learns generosity over greed.

### Negative Change Arc
Character descends, becomes worse.
```
Start: Resisting the lie
Middle: Tempted by lie
End: Embraces lie, corrupted
```
Example: Michael Corleone's descent in The Godfather.

### Flat Arc
Character already knows truth, changes the world.
```
Start: Knows the truth
Middle: World tests truth
End: Proves truth, changes others
```
Example: Katniss in The Hunger Games.

## Arc Components

### Want vs. Need
| Component | Definition | Example |
|-----------|------------|---------|
| **Want** | External goal | Win the competition |
| **Need** | Internal growth | Learn to trust others |

The story works when pursuing the Want forces confrontation with the Need.

### The Lie
The false belief the character holds:
- "I don't need anyone"
- "I'm not good enough"
- "Violence solves everything"
- "Love makes you weak"

### The Truth
What the character must learn:
- "Connection gives us strength"
- "I am worthy"
- "Understanding prevents violence"
- "Love is worth the risk"

### The Ghost (Wound)
The past event that created the lie:
- Abandonment led to "I don't need anyone"
- Failure led to "I'm not good enough"
- Childhood trauma led to the flaw

## Arc Beats by Structure

### Act One Arc Beats
| Story Beat | Arc Beat |
|------------|----------|
| Opening Image | Character in flawed state |
| Setup | Flaw demonstrated |
| Catalyst | Flaw creates problem |
| Debate | Flaw vs. opportunity |
| Break Into Two | Commits despite flaw |

### Act Two Arc Beats (First Half)
| Story Beat | Arc Beat |
|------------|----------|
| Fun and Games | Flaw seems to work |
| Midpoint | Glimpse of truth |

### Act Two Arc Beats (Second Half)
| Story Beat | Arc Beat |
|------------|----------|
| Bad Guys Close In | Flaw causes problems |
| All Is Lost | Flaw leads to disaster |
| Dark Night of Soul | Confronts the lie |

### Act Three Arc Beats
| Story Beat | Arc Beat |
|------------|----------|
| Break Into Three | Accepts truth |
| Finale | Acts from truth |
| Final Image | Transformation complete |

## Supporting Character Arcs

### Relationship Characters
Often carry the B-Story and theme:
- Mirror protagonist's arc
- Challenge protagonist's lie
- Model the truth

### Antagonist Arc
May have inverse arc:
- Believes opposite lie
- Tempts protagonist
- Falls when protagonist rises (or vice versa)

### Secondary Arcs
Supporting characters should have arcs too:
- Simpler than protagonist
- Connect to main theme
- Change from protagonist's influence

## Character Arc Template

```markdown
## Character Arc: [NAME]

### Core Arc
- **Lie believed:** [what they believe]
- **Truth to learn:** [what they must learn]
- **Ghost/Wound:** [what created the lie]

### Want vs. Need
- **Want (external):** [goal]
- **Need (internal):** [growth]

### Arc Type
[Positive/Negative/Flat]

### Transformation Markers
| Act | State | Evidence |
|-----|-------|----------|
| Opening | [state] | [scene/action] |
| Midpoint | [state] | [scene/action] |
| Low Point | [state] | [scene/action] |
| Climax | [state] | [scene/action] |
| End | [state] | [scene/action] |

### Key Relationship
- **Character:** [name]
- **Role:** [mirror/mentor/antagonist]
- **How they challenge lie:** [description]
```

## Arc Tracking Matrix

```markdown
## Arc Status: [SCREENPLAY]

| Character | Arc Type | Lie | Truth | Status |
|-----------|----------|-----|-------|--------|
| [Protagonist] | Positive | [lie] | [truth] | [Act X] |
| [Supporting] | Positive | [lie] | [truth] | [Act X] |
| [Antagonist] | Negative | [lie] | [truth] | [Act X] |
```

## Common Arc Problems

### No Clear Lie
- Character has no flaw to overcome
- Growth feels arbitrary
- **Fix:** Define the lie before writing

### Arc Happens Too Fast
- Transformation isn't earned
- Single scene "fixes" character
- **Fix:** Spread growth across multiple tests

### Arc Disconnected from Plot
- Internal and external stories don't connect
- Character changes for no plot reason
- **Fix:** Make plot events force internal change

### Supporting Characters Flat
- Only protagonist changes
- World feels static
- **Fix:** Give key supporting characters mini-arcs

## Validation Checklist
- [ ] Protagonist has clear lie/truth
- [ ] Ghost/wound explains the lie
- [ ] Want and need are distinct
- [ ] Arc connects to plot events
- [ ] Transformation shown through action
- [ ] Opening and final images show change
- [ ] Key relationships challenge the lie
- [ ] Supporting characters have arcs
