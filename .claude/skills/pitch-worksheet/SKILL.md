## The Pitch Mindset

Life's a pitch, and then you try! Pitching can create opportunities that you never dreamed of. Pitches don't always work - in fact, most of the time they don't. However, as a screenwriter you should always be ready to pitch your exciting, wonderful story ideas.

**Remember**: Always COPYRIGHT your pitches, scripts and treatments! You can't really protect an idea, but you can make it a unique creation in your copyrighted work.

## The Pitch Worksheet

### Logline
What is your story about? Keep it brief! (1-2 sentences maximum)

```

_______________________________________________

### Genre
Try to stick to one, but keep it simple if you mix genres.

```
PRIMARY: _______________ / SECONDARY: _______________
```

### The 3 Main Characters
Include the enemy/foe.

```

### Act 1: Setup
Introduce us to your main character. Tell us how they live; introduce your other characters. Tell us the moment where their life changes - that moment when nothing will be the same for them ever again - that moment that sets them on their journey.

```
_______________________________________________
_______________________________________________
_______________________________________________
```

### Act 2: Confrontation
Intensify the conflict, the journey - but be brief. What stands in their way? Tell us the moment when they are the furthest from their goal.

## Verbal Pitch Guidelines

### One-Minute Pitch Exercise
Come up with a one-minute pitch of your favorite movie. When the movie is reduced to a short pitch, what are the important points? Which lines, which events, which moments hold the story together?

### Rehearsal Tips
- **Don't memorize it**: This will only make it sound rehearsed
- **Sell the story**: As if you were telling a friend about an exciting event that just happened
- **Show enthusiasm**: Your passion for the project should be evident
- **Know your audience**: Tailor the pitch to who you're speaking with

## Pitch Structure Formula

```
[GENRE] about [PROTAGONIST] who [SETUP/STATUS QUO]
until [INCITING INCIDENT] forces them to [GOAL].
But [OBSTACLE/ANTAGONIST] [CONFLICT].
Now they must [STAKES/DECISION] or else [CONSEQUENCES].
```

### Examples
- **Raiders of the Lost Ark**: "An archeologist is hired by the U.S. government to find the Ark of the Covenant before the Nazis."
- **Gladiator**: "A Roman general is betrayed and his family killed by an insane emperor. Now a gladiator, he comes to Rome for revenge."
