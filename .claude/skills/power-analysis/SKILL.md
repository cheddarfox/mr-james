  This skill provides power dynamics analysis for screenplay scenes.
  Covers immediate, imminent, and underlying conflict types, antagonist
  relationships, and techniques for strengthening tension and stakes.

  Use when: analyzing conflict dynamics in a scene, strengthening antagonist
  relationships, identifying why a scene feels flat, or developing tension.

# Power Analysis Skill

## Invocation Triggers
Apply this skill when:
- Analyzing conflict dynamics in a scene
- Strengthening antagonist relationships
- Identifying why a scene feels flat
- Developing tension and stakes

## Understanding Power Structure

Power in a screenplay flows between characters, shifting throughout scenes and acts. Understanding power dynamics helps create compelling conflict.

### Types of Conflict

**Immediate Conflict**: Conflict happening right now, in the present moment of the scene.
- Physical confrontation
- Verbal argument
- Direct obstacle

**Imminent Conflict**: Conflict that is about to happen, creating tension and anticipation.
- Approaching deadline
- Inevitable confrontation
- Looming threat

**Best Practice**: The most effective scenes often contain BOTH immediate and imminent conflict.

## Power Analysis Exercise

### Part 1: Film Analysis
Watch a film you admire and analyze the movement of power throughout.

```markdown
## Power Analysis: [FILM TITLE]

### Power Shifts by Act

ACT ONE:
| Scene | Power Holder | Shift To | How |
|-------|--------------|----------|-----|
| | | | |

ACT TWO:
| Scene | Power Holder | Shift To | How |
|-------|--------------|----------|-----|
| | | | |

ACT THREE:
| Scene | Power Holder | Shift To | How |
|-------|--------------|----------|-----|
| | | | |

### Observations
- Who holds power at the start?
- How many times does power shift?
- What techniques cause power shifts?
- Who holds power at the end?
```

### Part 2: Conflict Scene Writing

**Exercise A**: Write a scene with ONLY immediate conflict.
- Two characters in direct opposition
- Conflict is happening NOW
- No reference to future consequences

**Exercise B**: Write a scene with ONLY imminent conflict.
- Tension from what's about to happen
- Characters aware of approaching crisis
- No direct confrontation in the scene

**Exercise C**: Write a scene with BOTH immediate AND imminent conflict.
- Present struggle
- Plus awareness of greater threat
- Layered tension

### Part 3: Desire/Obstacle Analysis

The following examples have a desire and obstacle. Create a reason that does not allow compromise to be an option.

**Example**:
```
DESIRE: Sally wants a new job so that she can move on with her life.
OBSTACLE: Her father, the boss, is the nicest guy in the world.
          It will break his heart if she quits.
REASON COMPROMISE IS NOT AN OPTION: ___________________
```

**Your Story**:
```
DESIRE: ___________________________________
OBSTACLE: ___________________________________
KIND OF CONFLICT: [ ] Immediate [ ] Imminent [ ] Both
REASON COMPROMISE IS NOT AN OPTION: ___________________________________
```

### Part 4: Story Power Audit

Take the story you're working on and identify the key elements of power, conflicts, and rising stakes. Eliminate or combine any elements that do not contribute to these.

```markdown
## Power Audit: [YOUR SCRIPT TITLE]

### Key Power Elements
1. ___________________________________
2. ___________________________________
3. ___________________________________

### Conflict Inventory
| Scene | Conflict Type | Power Dynamic | Stakes |
|-------|--------------|---------------|--------|
| | | | |
| | | | |
| | | | |

### Rising Stakes Progression
ACT ONE STAKES: ___________________________________
ACT TWO STAKES: ___________________________________
ACT THREE STAKES: ___________________________________

### Elements to ELIMINATE (don't contribute to power/conflict):
1. ___________________________________
2. ___________________________________

### Elements to COMBINE:
1. ___________________________________ + ___________________________________
```

## Power Dynamic Patterns

### Classic Power Structures
1. **Seesaw**: Power constantly shifts between protagonist and antagonist
2. **Descent**: Protagonist steadily loses power until the climax
3. **Ascent**: Protagonist steadily gains power (underdog story)
4. **Reversal**: Major power shift at midpoint
5. **Illusion**: Perceived power holder is not the real power

### Power Sources
- **Physical**: Strength, weapons, numbers
- **Positional**: Authority, title, rank
- **Economic**: Money, resources, property
- **Knowledge**: Information, secrets, skills
- **Relational**: Loyalty, love, obligation
- **Moral**: Righteousness, justice, truth

## Scene Power Checklist

For each major scene, verify:
- [ ] Power holder is clear at scene start
- [ ] At least one power shift occurs
- [ ] Immediate OR imminent conflict present
- [ ] Stakes are established
- [ ] Compromise is not an easy option
- [ ] Scene ends with changed power dynamic

## Validation Checklist
- [ ] Analyzed reference film for power movement
- [ ] Wrote immediate conflict scene
- [ ] Wrote imminent conflict scene
- [ ] Wrote combined conflict scene
- [ ] Identified protagonist's desire/obstacle/no-compromise
- [ ] Audited script for power elements
- [ ] Eliminated non-contributing elements
