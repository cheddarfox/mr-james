# Character Interview Skill

## Invocation Triggers
Apply this skill when:
- Creating new characters for a screenplay
- Deepening understanding of existing characters
- Building character backstory and motivation
- Developing character voice and mannerisms

## Interview Philosophy

Grab a couple of drinks, maybe make dinner and get ready to interview the character you are about to create for your screenplay. These questions will help you get to know your characters on a one-to-one basis, even if the exact information never shows up in your script.

As the God of your world that you created in your script, these questions will help you build a foundation and develop the characters you've created.

**Tip**: Put the questions and answers on index cards or divide each character separately. This will help create a backstory for each character later.

- Nicknames can hide embarrassing real names or project false bravado
- Avoid KILLER #1, KILLER#2 - use ONE EYED KILLER, FAT KILLER
- Don't use names hard to pronounce - it's distracting
- Don't give female characters male names - it confuses readers

**Examples**:
- MR. PAISLEY - kindly shoemaker
- JOEY - regular kind of guy
- NICKY - hard working guy
- ROCKO - tough guy image
- DOMINO - sexy in a dangerous way
