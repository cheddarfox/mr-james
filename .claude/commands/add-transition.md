# /add-transition

Insert a transition element in proper Fountain format.

## Arguments
- `[type]` - Required: Transition type (cut, fade, dissolve, etc.)

## Workflow

### Step 1: Identify Transition Type
Parse the requested transition and format correctly.

### Step 2: Format Transition
Standard transitions end in `TO:` and are right-aligned by Fountain:
```fountain

                                                      CUT TO:

```

### Step 3: Insert with Proper Spacing
- Blank line before transition
- Transition on its own line
- Blank line after transition (before next scene)

## Transition Types

### Standard Transitions
| Input | Output |
|-------|--------|
| `cut` | `CUT TO:` |
| `smash` | `SMASH CUT TO:` |
| `match` | `MATCH CUT TO:` |
| `jump` | `JUMP CUT TO:` |

### Fade Transitions
| Input | Output |
|-------|--------|
| `fade` | `FADE TO:` |
| `fade in` | `FADE IN:` |
| `fade out` | `FADE OUT.` |
| `fade black` | `FADE TO BLACK.` |
| `fade white` | `FADE TO WHITE.` |

### Dissolve Transitions
| Input | Output |
|-------|--------|
| `dissolve` | `DISSOLVE TO:` |
| `ripple` | `RIPPLE DISSOLVE TO:` |
| `cross` | `CROSS DISSOLVE TO:` |

### Time Transitions
| Input | Output |
|-------|--------|
| `time` | `TIME CUT:` |
| `later` | `LATER:` |

### Intercut
| Input | Output |
|-------|--------|
| `intercut` | `INTERCUT:` |

## Force Non-Standard Transitions

Use `>` prefix in Fountain:
```fountain
>BURN TO WHITE.

>SLAM TO:

>WIPE TO:
```

## Usage Guidelines

### When to Use Transitions
- **End of acts**: `FADE OUT.`
- **Script opening**: `FADE IN:`
- **Script closing**: `FADE OUT.` / `THE END`
- **Jarring juxtaposition**: `SMASH CUT TO:`
- **Visual match**: `MATCH CUT TO:`
- **Time passage**: `DISSOLVE TO:` / `TIME CUT:`

### When NOT to Use
- Between standard scenes (cut is implied)
- Every scene change (creates clutter)
- To pad page count

## Examples

```
User: /add-transition cut
Output:
                                                      CUT TO:
```

```
User: /add-transition fade out
Output:
                                                      FADE OUT.
```

```
User: /add-transition smash
Output:
                                                      SMASH CUT TO:
```

## Special Patterns

### Opening
```fountain
FADE IN:

EXT. CITY - NIGHT
```

### End of Act
```fountain
Sarah stares at the evidence.

                                                      FADE OUT.

                                                      END OF ACT ONE
```

### Script Ending
```fountain
Sarah walks into the light.

                                                      FADE OUT.

                                                      THE END
```

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Transition is uppercase
- [ ] Ends with `TO:` or `.`
- [ ] Blank line before
- [ ] Properly formatted for Fountain
- [ ] Used sparingly and purposefully
