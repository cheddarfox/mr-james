List your top 10 favorite films, and I'll help you identify:

```

### Step 4: Theme Pattern Analysis

Based on your personal experiences and movie preferences:

YOUR STRONGEST THEMES:
1. [Theme] - from [source]
2. [Theme] - from [source]
3. [Theme] - from [source]

Which resonates most for your screenplay?
