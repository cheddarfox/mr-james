# /logline

Create a compelling logline using the WTFB hook structure.

## Arguments
- `[title]` - Optional: Screenplay title

## Workflow

### Step 1: Gather Core Elements
```
Let's craft your logline!

A great logline has 4 components:
  - CHARACTERS: Who are they? What do they want?
  - CONFLICT: Main obstacle to achieving goal?
  - SETTING: Time period, genre, style
  - ACTION: Excitement - never be boring!

Tell me about your screenplay:
```

### Step 2: Extract Components

```markdown
## LOGLINE COMPONENTS

**PROTAGONIST**:
Who is your main character? (Be specific - not "a man" but "a disgraced surgeon")
> [gathered info]

**GOAL**:
What do they actively pursue?
> [gathered info]

**ANTAGONIST/OBSTACLE**:
Who or what opposes them?
> [gathered info]

**STAKES**:
What happens if they fail?
> [gathered info]

**UNIQUE ELEMENT**:
What makes THIS story different?
> [gathered info]
```

### Step 3: Generate Draft Loglines

Create 3 variations using different formulas:

```markdown
## DRAFT LOGLINES

### Version 1 (Basic Formula)
A [ADJECTIVE] [PROTAGONIST TYPE] must [GOAL]
when [CONFLICT], or else [STAKES].

> [generated logline]

### Version 2 (Setup-Catalyst Formula)
When [SETUP], a [PROTAGONIST] must [OBJECTIVE]
before [ANTAGONIST] [THREAT].

> [generated logline]

### Version 3 (Genre Formula)
A [GENRE] about [PROTAGONIST] who [SITUATION]
until [CATALYST] forces them to [ACTION]
against [ANTAGONIST/OBSTACLE].

> [generated logline]
```

### Step 4: Refine

```
Which version resonates most?

  1. Version 1: [logline]
  2. Version 2: [logline]
  3. Version 3: [logline]
  4. Combine elements from multiple

Let's refine your chosen version:
```

### Step 5: Quality Check

```markdown
## LOGLINE QUALITY CHECK

**FINAL LOGLINE**:
> [refined logline]

**Word Count**: [X] / 25 target

### Checklist
- [ ] Protagonist clearly identified
- [ ] Goal is active (character DOES something)

### Step 6: Compare to Classics

```markdown
## COMPARISON TO CLASSIC LOGLINES

**Raiders of the Lost Ark** (18 words):
"An archeologist is hired by the U.S. government to find
the Ark of the Covenant before the Nazis."

**Gladiator** (24 words):
"A Roman general is betrayed and his family killed by an
insane emperor. Now a gladiator, he comes to Rome for revenge."

**Your Logline** ([X] words):
"[Your logline]"

Does your logline have the same clarity and hook?
