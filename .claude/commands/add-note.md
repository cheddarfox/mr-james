# /add-note

Add a Fountain note (hidden in output) to the screenplay.

## Arguments
- `[type]` - Optional: TODO, QUESTION, ALT, CUT, EXPAND, RESEARCH, NOTE
- `[content]` - Required: The note content

## Workflow

### Step 1: Determine Note Type
If type specified, prefix content:
- `TODO:` - Action item
- `QUESTION:` - Needs clarification
- `ALT:` - Alternative approach
- `CUT:` - Consider removing
- `EXPAND:` - Needs development
- `RESEARCH:` - Needs fact-checking
- `NOTE:` - General observation

### Step 2: Format Note
```fountain
[[TYPE: Note content here]]
```

### Step 3: Insert at Location
- Inline: Within action or dialogue
- Between scenes: On its own line
- Multi-line: For longer notes

## Note Types

| Type | Purpose | Example |
|------|---------|---------|
| `TODO` | Action required | `[[TODO: Add confrontation beat]]` |
| `QUESTION` | Decision needed | `[[QUESTION: Should this be day or night?]]` |
| `ALT` | Alternative version | `[[ALT: Could also play this comedically]]` |
| `CUT` | Consider removal | `[[CUT: This may slow pacing]]` |
| `EXPAND` | Needs more | `[[EXPAND: Build tension here]]` |
| `RESEARCH` | Fact-check | `[[RESEARCH: Verify Seoul geography]]` |
| `NOTE` | General | `[[NOTE: Sets up Act 3 reveal]]` |

## Examples

```
User: /add-note todo Add Sarah's reaction shot
Output: [[TODO: Add Sarah's reaction shot]]

User: /add-note question Is this the right location for the reveal?
Output: [[QUESTION: Is this the right location for the reveal?]]

User: /add-note This scene mirrors the opening
Output: [[NOTE: This scene mirrors the opening]]
```

## Placement Patterns

### Inline Note
```fountain
Sarah hesitates at the door. [[TODO: Add physical business]]

She enters.
```

### Scene Note
```fountain
INT. WAREHOUSE - NIGHT

[[NOTE: This is the midpoint reversal. Everything changes here.]]

Sarah stands alone in the darkness.
```

### Multi-Line Note
```fountain
[[QUESTION: This scene could go two ways:
1. Sarah confronts John directly
2. Sarah pretends not to know

Need to decide which serves the character arc better.]]
```

### Before Boneyard
```fountain
[[CUT: Removing for pacing. Preserving in boneyard below.]]

/*
INT. DINER - NIGHT

Cut scene content here...
*/
```

## Note Management

### Finding Notes
Search for patterns:
- All notes: `\[\[`
- TODOs: `\[\[TODO:`
- Questions: `\[\[QUESTION:`

### Clearing Notes
Before final export:
1. Review all notes
2. Resolve action items
3. Answer questions
4. Remove or keep intentionally

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Double brackets used [[]]
- [ ] Type prefix if specified
- [ ] Clear, actionable content
- [ ] Proper placement
