# /power-analysis

Analyze power dynamics and conflict structure in your screenplay.

## Arguments
- `[screenplay-file]` - Optional: Path to screenplay file
- `[scene]` - Optional: Specific scene to analyze

## Workflow

### Step 1: Identify Scope
```
What would you like to analyze?

  1. Full screenplay - Power movement throughout
  2. Specific scene - Deep dive on one scene
  3. Learn the technique - Practice with examples first
```

### Step 2a: Full Screenplay Analysis
Read screenplay and chart power movement:

```markdown
## POWER ANALYSIS: [TITLE]

### Power Map by Act

#### ACT ONE
| Scene | Power Holder | Shift To | Technique |
|-------|--------------|----------|-----------|
| [#] | [character] | [character] | [how] |
| [#] | [character] | [character] | [how] |

#### ACT TWO
| Scene | Power Holder | Shift To | Technique |
|-------|--------------|----------|-----------|
| [#] | [character] | [character] | [how] |
| [#] | [character] | [character] | [how] |

#### ACT THREE
| Scene | Power Holder | Shift To | Technique |
|-------|--------------|----------|-----------|
| [#] | [character] | [character] | [how] |
| [#] | [character] | [character] | [how] |

### Observations
- Opening power holder: [character]
- Total power shifts: [count]
- Final power holder: [character]
- Pattern: [seesaw/descent/ascent/reversal/illusion]
```

### Step 2b: Scene Analysis
For specific scene, analyze:

```markdown
## SCENE POWER ANALYSIS

### Scene: [HEADING]

#### Conflict Type
- [X] Immediate (happening now)
- [X] Imminent (about to happen)
- [X] Both

#### Power Dynamics
- Opens with power: [character]
- Power source: [physical/positional/economic/knowledge/relational/moral]
- Shift point: [description]
- Closes with power: [character]

#### Desire/Obstacle/Stakes
- DESIRE: [what protagonist wants]
- OBSTACLE: [what blocks them]
- REASON COMPROMISE IS NOT AN OPTION: [why]

#### Assessment
- Power shift earned: [Yes/No]
- Tension maintained: [Yes/No]
- Stakes clear: [Yes/No]
```

### Step 2c: Practice Exercise
Guide user through the technique:

```
Let's practice power analysis!

EXERCISE 1: Write a scene with ONLY immediate conflict.
(Two characters in direct opposition, conflict happening NOW)

EXERCISE 2: Write a scene with ONLY imminent conflict.
(Tension from what's about to happen, no direct confrontation)

EXERCISE 3: Write a scene with BOTH.
(Present struggle plus awareness of greater threat)

Which exercise would you like to try?
```

### Step 3: Recommendations

```markdown
## RECOMMENDATIONS

### Scenes Needing Power Strengthening
1. Scene [#]: [issue and suggestion]
2. Scene [#]: [issue and suggestion]

### Missing Conflict Types
- Immediate conflict needed in: [scenes]
- Imminent conflict needed in: [scenes]

### Power Pattern Issues
- [specific issue and fix]

### Rising Stakes
- Current progression: [description]
- Suggested enhancement: [description]
```
