Track and validate character arcs throughout your screenplay.

## Arguments
- `[character-name]` - Optional: Focus on specific character
- `[screenplay-file]` - Optional: Path to screenplay file

## Workflow

### Step 1: Identify Characters
If no character specified, analyze screenplay and list main characters:

```
Which character arc should we analyze?

MAIN CHARACTERS FOUND:
  1. [Protagonist name]
  2. [Antagonist name]
  3. [Supporting character]
  4. All main characters

Select a number or name a character:
```

### Step 2: Identify Starting Point
```markdown
## CHARACTER ARC: [NAME]

### STARTING POINT (Act One)

What is [NAME]'s viewpoint at the start?
> [identified or ask user]

What do they believe?
> [identified or ask user]

What is their flaw or limitation?
> [identified or ask user]

What is their status/position?
> [identified or ask user]
```

### Step 3: Track Events
Identify events that change the character's viewpoint:

```markdown
### TRANSFORMATIVE EVENTS

#### Event 1: [Page ___]
What happens: [description]
Impact on viewpoint: [how it changes them]

#### Event 2: [Page ___]
What happens: [description]
Impact on viewpoint: [how it changes them]

#### Event 3: [Page ___]
What happens: [description]
Impact on viewpoint: [how it changes them]

#### Midpoint Shift: [Page ___]
What changes: [description]
New direction: [description]

#### Dark Night/Crisis: [Page ___]
Lowest point: [description]
Confronting truth: [what they realize]
```

### Step 4: Identify Ending Point
```markdown
### ENDING POINT (Act Three)

What is [NAME]'s new viewpoint?
> [identified]

What do they now believe?
> [identified]

Is their flaw resolved or embraced?
> [identified]

What is their new status/position?
> [identified]
```

### Step 5: Assess Arc

```markdown
### ARC ASSESSMENT

**Arc Type**:
[ ] Positive (growth) - overcomes flaw
[ ] Negative (fall) - succumbs to flaw
[ ] Transformational - becomes different
[ ] Flat (catalyst) - changes others, not self

**Degree of Change**:
[ ] Dramatic - fundamental transformation
[ ] Moderate - significant but not total
[ ] Subtle - small but meaningful

**Arc Visibility**:
[ ] Clearly shown on screen
[ ] Partially visible
[ ] Mostly told, not shown

**Arc Earned**:
[ ] Yes - events justify the change
[ ] Partially - needs more building
[ ] No - change feels unearned

**Arc Supports Theme**:
[ ] Strongly aligned
[ ] Loosely connected
[ ] Disconnected
```

### Step 6: Multi-Character Arc Chart
If analyzing all characters:

```markdown
### MULTI-CHARACTER ARC SUMMARY

| Character | ACT 1 | ACT 2 | ACT 3 | Arc Type |
|-----------|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| [Name] | [state] | [state] | [state] | [type] |
| [Name] | [state] | [state] | [state] | [type] |
| [Name] | [state] | [state] | [state] | [type] |
```

### Step 7: Recommendations

```markdown
### RECOMMENDATIONS

**Issues Found**:
1. [Issue with specific character/scene]
2. [Issue with specific character/scene]

**Suggested Fixes**:
1. [Specific action]
2. [Specific action]

**Arc Strengthening**:
- Add event at [location] to show [change]
- Clarify moment of realization at [scene]
- Make [character]'s transformation more visible by [action]
```

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Starting viewpoint clearly identified
- [ ] Key transformative events documented
- [ ] Ending viewpoint different from start
- [ ] Arc type classified
- [ ] Arc supports theme
- [ ] Issues and fixes identified
