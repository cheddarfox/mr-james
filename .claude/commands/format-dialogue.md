# /format-dialogue

Structure a dialogue block correctly in Fountain format.

## Arguments
- `[character]` - Required: Character name
- `[extension]` - Optional: V.O., O.S., CONT'D, etc.

## Workflow

### Step 1: Validate Character
- Check character exists in registry
- Verify correct name spelling
- Use consistent capitalization

### Step 2: Format Dialogue Block
```fountain

CHARACTER
Dialogue text here.
```

With extension:
```fountain

CHARACTER (V.O.)
Dialogue text here.
```

With parenthetical:
```fountain

CHARACTER
(emotional direction)
Dialogue text here.
```

### Step 3: Verify Spacing
- Blank line before character name
- No blank line between character and dialogue
- Blank line after dialogue block (before next element)

## Extension Reference

| Extension | Meaning | Usage |
|-----------|---------|-------|
| `(V.O.)` | Voice Over | Narration, not in scene |
| `(O.S.)` | Off Screen | In scene, not visible |
| `(O.C.)` | Off Camera | Same as O.S. |
| `(CONT'D)` | Continued | Same speaker after action |
| `(PRE-LAP)` | Pre-lap | Audio before scene |
| `(INTO PHONE)` | Delivery | On phone |
| `(SUBTITLE)` | Translation | Foreign language |

## Dialogue Patterns

### Basic Dialogue
```fountain

SARAH
I don't think that's a good idea.
```

### With Parenthetical
```fountain

SARAH
(hesitant)
I don't think that's a good idea.
```

### Multiple Parentheticals
```fountain

JOHN
(laughing)
You're kidding.
(realizes she's not)
Oh. You're not kidding.
```

### Continued Dialogue
```fountain

SARAH
We need to talk.

She crosses to the window.

SARAH (CONT'D)
About what happened last night.
```

### Dual Dialogue
```fountain

JACK
I love you!

JILL ^
I hate you!
```

## Examples

```
User: /format-dialogue sarah
Output:

SARAH
[dialogue here]
```

```
User: /format-dialogue john vo
Output:

JOHN (V.O.)
[dialogue here]
```

```
User: /format-dialogue sarah cont'd hesitant
Output:

SARAH (CONT'D)

[dialogue here]
```

```

SARAH (VO)
SARAH - V.O.

// Right
SARAH (V.O.)
```
