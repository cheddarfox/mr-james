Apply the WTFB 6-step rewriting methodology to your screenplay.

## Arguments
- `[screenplay-file]` - Optional: Path to screenplay file

## Workflow

### Step 1: Identify Script
```
Ready to apply the WTFB rewriting methodology!

This is a comprehensive process that will:
  1. Identify all story threads
  2. Chart arcs across acts
  3. Find holes in your structure
  4. Grade every scene
  5. Elevate weak scenes
  6. Compress for maximum impact

Which screenplay should we analyze?
```

### Step 2: Story Thread Identification
```markdown
## STEP 1: IDENTIFY THE STORIES

List every story thread by completing "The story of..."

### Main Plots
1. The story of [protagonist] who [journey]
2. The story of [relationship between X and Y]
3. The story of [theme exploration]

### Subplots
4. The story of [subplot A]
5. The story of [subplot B]

[Continue for all threads identified]
```

### Step 3: Arc Charting
```markdown
## STEP 2: CHART THE ARCS

| Story Thread | Beginning | Act One | Act Two | Act Three | Finish |
|--------------|-----------|---------|---------|-----------|--------|
| Main Plot | | | | | |
| B-Story | | | | | |
| Character Arc | | | | | |
| Subplot 1 | | | | | |
| Subplot 2 | | | | | |
```

### Step 4: Hole Finding
```markdown
## STEP 3: FIND THE HOLES

Look at the chart. Identify:

### Missing Beats
- Story thread [X] is missing from [Act]
- [Character]'s arc has no [beginning/middle/end]

### Threads That Disappear
- [Subplot] introduced in Act One, absent in Act Two
- [Character] mentioned but never resolved

### Incomplete Arcs
- [Thread] starts but doesn't complete
- Resolution for [conflict] is missing

### HOLES TO FIX
1. ___________________________________
   Location: ___________
   Solution: ___________

2. ___________________________________
   Location: ___________
   Solution: ___________
```

### Step 5: Scene Grading
```markdown
## STEP 4: GRADE YOUR SCENES

| Scene # | Location | Grade | Issue/Note |
|---------|----------|-------|------------|
| 1 | | | |
| 2 | | | |
| 3 | | | |
[Continue for all scenes]

### GRADE KEY
- **A**: Essential, well-executed, couldn't be better
- **B**: Good, serves story, minor improvements possible
- **C**: Adequate, needs work
- **D**: Weak, may not be necessary
- **F**: Fails to serve story, cut or rewrite

### GRADE SUMMARY
- A Scenes: [count]
- B Scenes: [count]
- C Scenes: [count]
- D Scenes: [count]
- F Scenes: [count]
```

### Step 6: Best Scene Analysis
```markdown
## STEP 5: ELEVATE TO YOUR BEST

Your best scene is: Scene [#] - [location]

### What makes it work:
1. [Quality 1]
2. [Quality 2]
3. [Quality 3]

### Apply these qualities to weaker scenes:

**Scene [#]** (Current: [grade])
- Lacks: [what's missing]
- Add: [specific improvement]

**Scene [#]** (Current: [grade])
- Lacks: [what's missing]
- Add: [specific improvement]

[Continue for all C, D, F scenes]
```

### Step 7: Compression Targets
```markdown
## STEP 6: COMPRESS

### Scenes to CUT entirely:
- Scene [#]: [reason]
- Scene [#]: [reason]

### Scenes to SHORTEN:
- Scene [#]: Enter later at [point]
- Scene [#]: Exit earlier at [point]
- Scene [#]: Remove [what]

### Dialogue to TRIM:
- Page [#]: Cut [what]
- Page [#]: Cut [what]

### Characters to COMBINE:
- [Character A] + [Character B] → serve same function

### ESTIMATED PAGE REDUCTION: [X] pages
```

### Step 8: Rewrite Action Plan
```markdown
## REWRITE ACTION PLAN

### Priority 1: Fix Holes
1. [specific action]
2. [specific action]

### Priority 2: Cut/Rewrite F Scenes
1. [specific action]
2. [specific action]

### Priority 3: Elevate D Scenes
1. [specific action]
2. [specific action]

### Priority 4: Strengthen C Scenes
1. [specific action]
2. [specific action]

### Priority 5: Compress
1. [specific action]
2. [specific action]
