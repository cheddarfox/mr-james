Perform three-act structure analysis on the screenplay.

## Arguments
- `[framework]` - Optional: `three-act`, `save-the-cat`, `hero-journey`, `sequence`

## Workflow

### Step 1: Load Screenplay
- Read complete .fountain file
- Count total pages
- Identify all scene headings

### Step 2: Identify Structure Points
Map key story beats to page numbers:

#### Three-Act (Default)
| Beat | Target Page | Actual |
|------|-------------|--------|
| Opening Image | 1 | ? |
| Theme Stated | 5 | ? |
| Catalyst | 12 | ? |
| Break Into Two | 25 | ? |
| B Story | 30 | ? |
| Midpoint | 55 | ? |
| All Is Lost | 75 | ? |
| Dark Night | 75-85 | ? |
| Break Into Three | 85 | ? |
| Finale | 85-110 | ? |
| Final Image | 110 | ? |

### Step 3: Calculate Proportions
```markdown
| Act | Target % | Actual % | Pages |
|-----|----------|----------|-------|
| One | 25% | ?% | ?-? |
| Two | 50% | ?% | ?-? |
| Three | 25% | ?% | ?-? |
```

### Step 4: Generate Analysis

```markdown
## Structure Analysis: [TITLE]

### Framework: [Three-Act/Save the Cat/etc.]
### Total Pages: [X]

### Act Breakdown
[Table of act proportions]

### Beat Placement
[Table of beats with variance from target]

### Structural Strengths
- [What works]

### Structural Issues
- [What needs attention]

### Recommendations
1. [Specific adjustment]
2. [Specific adjustment]
```

## Framework Options

### Three-Act Structure
Standard Hollywood structure with Setup, Confrontation, Resolution.

### Save the Cat! (Blake Snyder)
15-beat commercial structure with specific page targets.

### Hero's Journey (Vogler)
12-stage mythic structure mapping the hero's transformation.

### Sequence Method
8-sequence format dividing the screenplay into mini-movies.

## Output Example

```markdown
## Structure Analysis: Seoul Identity

### Framework: Three-Act
### Total Pages: 105

### Act Breakdown
| Act | Target | Actual | Status |
|-----|--------|--------|--------|
| One | 26 (25%) | 28 (27%) | ⚠️ Slightly long |
| Two | 53 (50%) | 49 (47%) | ⚠️ Slightly short |
| Three | 26 (25%) | 28 (27%) | ⚠️ Slightly long |

### Beat Placement
| Beat | Target | Actual | Variance |
|------|--------|--------|----------|
| Catalyst | 12 | 15 | +3 ⚠️ |
| Break Into Two | 25 | 28 | +3 ⚠️ |
| Midpoint | 52 | 50 | -2 ✓ |
| All Is Lost | 79 | 72 | -7 ⚠️ |
| Break Into Three | 89 | 85 | -4 ✓ |

### Structural Strengths
- Strong midpoint reversal at appropriate page
- Clear break into Act Three
- Final image effectively mirrors opening

### Structural Issues
- Catalyst comes late, delaying story momentum
- All Is Lost occurs early, making Act 2B feel rushed
- Act One runs long with too much setup

### Recommendations
1. Trim setup scenes in Act One to hit catalyst by page 12
2. Extend the "Bad Guys Close In" section before All Is Lost
3. Consider combining or cutting exposition scenes 5-8
