Analyze the current project state and provide helpful, context-aware guidance.

## Arguments
None - automatically analyzes current project state

## Workflow

### Step 1: Analyze Project State

Check for:
1. Existence of `.fountain` file(s)
2. Current page count (estimate from line count)
3. Number of scenes
4. Last scene written
5. Any uncommitted changes
6. Notes or TODOs in the screenplay

### Step 2: Determine User Situation

| Situation | Indicators |
|-----------|------------|
| No project | No .fountain files found |
| Empty project | Only title page, no scenes |
| Early draft | Less than 15 pages |
| Mid-draft | 15-80 pages |
| Late draft | More than 80 pages |
| Revision mode | Complete draft exists |

### Step 3: Provide Contextual Guidance

#### No Project Found

```
You haven't started a screenplay yet!

Here's how to begin:

  /start-project   Set up a new screenplay
  /import          Bring in an existing script

Or just tell me:
  - Your story idea
  - Who your main character is
  - What happens in the opening

I'll help you from there!
```

#### Empty Project (Only Title Page)

```
You've got your screenplay file set up - great start!

The blank page can feel intimidating. Here are some ways in:

If you know your opening:
  - Just describe it: "A woman sits alone in a diner..."
  - Use /start-scene to set up the location

If you're still figuring things out:
  - Tell me your logline
  - Describe your main character
  - Tell me what kind of story this is

What feels right to start?
```

#### Early Draft (< 15 pages)

```
You're in the early pages - finding your story!

Current Status:
  Pages: ~[X]
  Scenes: [Y]
  Last scene: [Scene heading]

This is the "discovery" phase. What might help:

  /start-scene         Continue from where you left off
  /analyze-structure   See how your setup is shaping up
  Just tell me         What happens next in your story

Common questions at this stage:
  - "Is my opening working?"
  - "When should the inciting incident happen?"
  - "How do I introduce my characters?"

What's on your mind?
```

#### Mid-Draft (15-80 pages)

```
You're in the thick of it - the marathon section!

Current Status:
  Pages: ~[X]
  Scenes: [Y]
  Position: [Estimated act/sequence]

This is where many writers hit walls. Here's what might help:

If you're lost in the story:
  /analyze-structure   See where you are in the structure
  /scene-list          Review what you've written

If a scene isn't working:
  - Tell me which one and what feels off
  - I can help with pacing, dialogue, or stakes

If you know what happens but can't write it:
  - Just describe it in plain language
  - I'll help shape it into screenplay format

What's blocking you right now?
```

#### Late Draft (> 80 pages)

```
You're in the home stretch!

Current Status:
  Pages: ~[X]
  Scenes: [Y]

Final act considerations:
  - Does your climax pay off your setup?
  - Is your protagonist's journey complete?
  - Does the ending feel earned?

What might help:
  /analyze-structure   Check your final act pacing
  /check-continuity    Look for loose ends
  /scene-list          Review your third act scenes

You're almost there. What do you need to finish?
```

#### Revision Mode (Complete Draft)

```
Congratulations on completing a draft!

Current Status:
  Pages: ~[X]
  Scenes: [Y]

Ready for revision? Here are your tools:

Analysis:
  /analyze-structure      Structure and pacing
  /analyze-character      Character arc review
  /check-continuity       Continuity check
  /check-format           Format validation

Common revision passes:
  1. Structure - Are beats in the right places?
  2. Character - Distinct voices? Complete arcs?
  3. Dialogue - Natural? Subtext-rich?
  4. Action - Visual? Economical?
  5. Format - Industry-ready?

What kind of revision are you doing?
```

### Step 4: Offer Specific Next Steps

Always end with 2-3 concrete options:

```
Your next steps:

  1. [Most relevant action based on situation]
  2. [Alternative helpful action]
  3. Tell me what's really on your mind

What works for you?
```
