# /analyze-character

Analyze a character's arc, appearances, and development.

## Arguments
- `[character]` - Required: Character name to analyze

## Workflow

### Step 1: Find All Appearances
Search screenplay for:
- Character name in dialogue headers
- Character name in action (CAPS on first, then mentions)
- References by other characters

### Step 2: Map Arc Points
Track character state at key structural moments:

```markdown
| Point | Page | Character State | Evidence |
|-------|------|-----------------|----------|
| Introduction | ? | [initial state] | [scene/action] |
| End Act One | ? | [state] | [evidence] |
| Midpoint | ? | [state] | [evidence] |
| Low Point | ? | [state] | [evidence] |
| Climax | ? | [state] | [evidence] |
| Resolution | ? | [final state] | [evidence] |
```

### Step 3: Identify Arc Elements
- **Lie believed**: What false belief do they hold?
- **Truth to learn**: What must they discover?
- **Want**: External goal
- **Need**: Internal growth required

### Step 4: Analyze Relationships
```markdown
| Character | Relationship | Evolution |
|-----------|--------------|-----------|
| [name] | [type] | [how it changes] |
```

### Step 5: Generate Report

```markdown
## Character Analysis: [NAME]

### Overview
- **Role**: [protagonist/antagonist/supporting]
- **Arc Type**: [positive/negative/flat]
- **Scenes**: [X] appearances
- **First Appearance**: Page [Y]

### Arc Summary
- **Lie**: [false belief]
- **Truth**: [what they learn]
- **Want**: [external goal]
- **Need**: [internal need]

### Transformation
[Table of arc points]

### Key Relationships
[Relationship table]

### Strengths
- [What works in this character's arc]

### Issues
- [What needs development]

### Recommendations
1. [Specific improvement]
```

## Analysis Elements

### Arc Type Detection
- **Positive**: Character overcomes flaw → look for growth moments
- **Negative**: Character descends → look for corruption moments
- **Flat**: Character stays same, changes world → look for influence moments

### Voice Consistency
- Track vocabulary patterns
- Note speech rhythm
- Check for voice drift

### Screen Time
- Total scenes
- Total dialogue lines
- Percentage of screenplay

## Output Example

```markdown
## Character Analysis: SARAH

### Overview
- **Role**: Protagonist
- **Arc Type**: Positive Change
- **Scenes**: 45 appearances
- **First Appearance**: Page 1

### Arc Summary
- **Lie**: "I can't trust anyone"
- **Truth**: "Connection makes us stronger"
- **Want**: Find her father's killer
- **Need**: Learn to trust again

### Transformation
| Point | Page | State | Evidence |
|-------|------|-------|----------|
| Intro | 1 | Isolated, distrustful | Pushes away partner |
| End Act 1 | 25 | Reluctantly accepts help | Lets John assist |
| Midpoint | 52 | Beginning to open up | Shares her past |
| Low Point | 72 | Betrayed, walls go up | "I knew better" |
| Climax | 95 | Chooses to trust | Relies on team |
| Resolution | 105 | Transformed | Initiates connection |

### Key Relationships
| Character | Relationship | Evolution |
|-----------|--------------|-----------|
| JOHN | Partner | Suspicion → Trust → Betrayal → Forgiveness |
| DETECTIVE PARK | Mentor | Resistance → Respect |
| VILLAIN | Antagonist | Unknown threat → Personal enemy |

### Strengths
- Clear want/need distinction
- Arc maps well to structure
- Transformation is earned through action

### Issues
- Midpoint turn feels abrupt (pages 50-52)
- Low point recovery too quick
- Need more "refusing help" beats in Act One

### Recommendations
1. Add scene showing Sarah's backstory (why she doesn't trust)
2. Extend the recovery from betrayal (add Dark Night scene)
3. Add one more "push away" moment before Act One break
```
