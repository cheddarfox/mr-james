# /new-character

Add a new character with proper introduction and tracking.

## Arguments
- `[name]` - Required: Character name
- `[age]` - Optional: Age or age range
- `[description]` - Optional: Brief description

## Workflow

### Step 1: Character Setup
Gather information:
- Full name for registry
- How they appear in script (usually FIRST NAME)
- Age range
- Key physical description

### Step 2: Create Character Introduction
Generate introduction in action:
```fountain
[NAME] ([age], [brief vivid description])
```

### Step 3: Add to Character Registry
```markdown
### [CHARACTER NAME]
- First Appearance: Scene [X], Page [Y]
- Age: [range]
- Description: [details]
- Role: [protagonist/antagonist/supporting]
```

### Step 4: Set Up Dialogue Block
Prepare first dialogue opportunity:
```fountain
[CHARACTER NAME]
(first line ready)
```

## Introduction Best Practices

### Good Introductions
```fountain
SARAH CHEN (30s, sharp eyes behind wire-rim glasses)

DETECTIVE PARK (50s, the kind of tired that coffee can't fix)

MARCUS (20s, all nervous energy and expensive sneakers)
```

### Avoid
```fountain
// Too vague
SARAH, an attractive woman, enters.

// Too detailed (casting)
JOHN, 6'2", brown hair, blue eyes, muscular build.

// Passive
A woman named SARAH is seen sitting there.
```
