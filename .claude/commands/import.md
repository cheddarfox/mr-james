# /import

Import an existing screenplay or source material into your project.

## Arguments
- `[path]` - Optional: Path to file or folder to import
- `[type]` - Optional: `screenplay`, `notes`, `reference`

## Workflow

### Step 1: Identify Source

If no path provided, ask:

```
What would you like to import?

You can share:
  - A file path (drag and drop works!)
  - A folder with multiple files
  - Or just paste content directly here

I can read:
  - Final Draft (.fdx)
  - PDF documents
  - Word documents (.docx)
  - Fountain files (.fountain)
  - Images of pages (.jpg, .png)
  - Plain text (.txt, .md)
```

### Step 2: Detect File Type

Read the file and determine format:

| Extension | Handler |
|-----------|---------|
| .fdx | Parse Final Draft XML structure |
| .pdf | Extract text, detect screenplay formatting |
| .docx | Extract document content |
| .fountain | Validate and import directly |
| .jpg/.png/.heic | Read image, transcribe visible text |
| .txt/.md | Parse for screenplay or note content |
| folder | Scan all files, present summary |

### Step 3: Process by Format

#### Final Draft (.fdx)

1. Parse the XML structure
2. Extract:
   - Title page information
   - Scene headings
   - Action blocks
   - Character names and dialogue
   - Transitions
3. Convert to Fountain format
4. Show preview

Display:
```
Found a Final Draft screenplay!

Title: [Title from file]
Pages: ~[X]
Scenes: [Y]
Characters: [Top 5 names]

Preview:
------------------------------------------------------------
[First 15 lines in Fountain format]
------------------------------------------------------------

This look right?
  Yes, save it     Create [title].fountain
  Show more        See more of the conversion
  Fix the title    Change the screenplay title
```

#### PDF Document

1. Read and extract text
2. Detect if screenplay format:
   - Scene headings (INT./EXT.)
   - Character cues (centered, caps)
   - Dialogue blocks
3. If screenplay: Convert to Fountain
4. If prose/notes: Offer to save as reference or analyze

Display for screenplay:
```
Found a screenplay in this PDF!

Detected:
  - [X] scenes
  - [Y] characters
  - ~[Z] pages

Preview of opening:
------------------------------------------------------------
[First 15 lines converted to Fountain]
------------------------------------------------------------

How does this look?
  Yes, save it        Create the Fountain file
  Show more           See more pages
  Something's off     Tell me what looks wrong
```

Display for non-screenplay:
```
This looks like notes or a treatment (not a formatted screenplay).

I found:
  - Story content about [brief description]
  - Characters mentioned: [names]

Would you like to:
  1. Keep as reference material (save to source-materials/)
  2. Create a beat sheet from this content
  3. Use this to start a new screenplay
```

#### Word Document (.docx)

Same logic as PDF - detect if screenplay or prose, process accordingly.

#### Fountain File

1. Validate syntax
2. Check for issues
3. Copy to project root

Display:
```
Found a Fountain screenplay!

Title: [Title]
Scenes: [X]
Format check: [Pass/issues found]

Copying to your workspace...

Done! Your screenplay is ready.
  /start-scene        Continue writing
  /check-format       Run full validation
  /scene-list         See all scenes
```

#### Images

1. Read image and transcribe all visible text
2. Detect if screenplay format or handwritten notes
3. For multiple images, process in sequence
4. Show transcription for review

Display:
```
Reading your image...

Transcribed content:
------------------------------------------------------------
[Transcribed text from image]
------------------------------------------------------------

This is from a [screenplay/handwritten notes].

How does the transcription look?
  Looks good         Save and continue
  Add more pages     Import another image
  Fix errors         Tell me what's wrong
```

#### Folder

1. Scan folder for supported file types
2. Present summary

Display:
```
Found [X] files in this folder:

  Screenplays:
    - script_v2.fdx (Final Draft)
    - old_draft.pdf

  Reference Materials:
    - character_notes.docx
    - research.pdf

  Images:
    - page_scan_01.jpg
    - page_scan_02.jpg

Which would you like to import?
  1. Import the screenplay (script_v2.fdx)
  2. Import all reference materials
  3. Transcribe the images
  4. Let me choose specific files
```

### Step 4: Save and Organize

Create files in appropriate locations:
- Screenplay: `[title-slug].fountain` at project root
- Notes/reference: `source-materials/[filename]`
- Images: Keep originals in `source-materials/scans/`

### Step 5: Confirm and Next Steps

Display completion with next actions:
```
Import complete!

Created: [filename].fountain

Your screenplay is ready. What's next?
  /start-scene         Continue writing
  /check-format        Validate the import
  /analyze-structure   Analyze the structure
  /scene-list          See all scenes
```

## Error Handling

### File Not Found
```
I couldn't find that file.

Try:
  - Drag and drop the file into this chat
  - Copy the full file path
  - Check that the file exists

Or just paste the content directly - that works too!
```

### Unreadable Format
```
I'm not sure how to read this file type ([extension]).

I work best with:
  - Final Draft (.fdx)
  - PDF documents
  - Word documents (.docx)
  - Fountain files (.fountain)
  - Images (.jpg, .png)
  - Plain text (.txt, .md)

Try exporting to PDF from your application, or paste the content directly.
```

### Partial Recognition
```
I found content, but some parts are unclear.

Here's what I'm confident about:
[Clear content]

Here's what I'm unsure about:
[Uncertain content marked with ???]

Can you help clarify these parts?
```

## Success Criteria
- [ ] File successfully read
- [ ] Content converted to Fountain format (if applicable)
- [ ] User approves the conversion
- [ ] File saved to appropriate location
- [ ] User knows their next steps
