## WTFB Rewriting Philosophy

When reviewing for standards, apply the WTFB rewriting methodology:

### Scene Grading System
Grade every scene: A, B, C, D, F

- **A**: Essential, well-executed, couldn't be better
- **B**: Good, serves story, minor improvements possible
- **C**: Adequate, needs work
- **D**: Weak, may not be necessary
- **F**: Fails to serve story, cut or rewrite

### "Best Scene" Principle
**Make every scene as good as your best scene.**

Identify the A+ scene, analyze why it works, apply those qualities throughout.

### Compression Philosophy
**Compression is artful - shorten everything.**

- Enter scenes later
- Exit scenes earlier
- Cut dialogue to essence
- Remove redundant action lines
- Combine characters where possible
- Eliminate non-advancing scenes

### Arc Charting Method
Before final review, verify:
1. All story threads complete from beginning to finish
2. No threads disappear mid-script
3. No holes in the arc chart
4. All threads converge appropriately

### Treatment Format Reminder
When generating treatments, per WTFB:
- Write in present tense, short-story style (NOT novel)
- Focus on key plot points, tone, genre
- Leave out unimportant subplots
- Include: Title, logline, Act 1/2/3 explanations, wrap-up
