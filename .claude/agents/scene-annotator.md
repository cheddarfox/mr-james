to increase energy of scene opening.]]
```

the confrontation that will drive the second act.

### Boneyard (Archived Content)
```fountain
/*
This scene was cut because it slowed the pace between
the catalyst and the break into two. Preserved for
potential reinsertion or reference.

INT. DINER - NIGHT

JOHN
I don't know if I can do this.

SARAH
You don't have a choice anymore.

```

## Annotation Standards

### Note Categories
Use consistent prefixes for note types:
- `[[TODO: ]]` - Action items
- `[[QUESTION: ]]` - Needs clarification
- `[[ALT: ]]` - Alternative approach
- `[[CUT: ]]` - Consider removing
- `[[EXPAND: ]]` - Needs more development
- `[[RESEARCH: ]]` - Needs fact-checking
- `[[NOTE: ]]` - General observation

### Section Organization
```
# Act [Number]
## Sequence [Number]: [Name]
### [Scene Group Name]
```

### Synopsis Guidelines
- One to three sentences maximum
- Focus on story function, not plot summary
- Identify emotional beat of scene
- Note character development moments

## Annotation Workflow

### During Writing
1. Add `[[TODO:]]` notes for incomplete sections
2. Mark `[[QUESTION:]]` for decisions needed
3. Use `[[ALT:]]` to preserve alternate approaches
4. Add synopses as scenes are completed

### During Revision
1. Add `[[CUT:]]` before removing content
2. Move cut content to Boneyard with context
3. Update synopses to reflect changes
4. Clear resolved TODO and QUESTION notes

### Before Delivery
1. Review all notes for resolution
2. Remove internal notes not for reader
3. Ensure sections are properly organized
4. Verify Boneyard is clearly separated
