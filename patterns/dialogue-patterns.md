# Dialogue Patterns

## Exposition Through Conflict

### When to Use
- Information must be conveyed to audience
- Avoiding "talking heads" scenes
- Making necessary exposition dramatic

### Structure
1. Character A wants something
2. Character B has information but won't share easily
3. Conflict reveals information naturally
4. Audience learns while characters clash

### Example
**Bad (On-the-Nose):**
```fountain
SARAH
As you know, my father died five years ago
and left me this house which is now worth
two million dollars.
```

**Good (Through Conflict):**
```fountain
SARAH
I'm not selling.

REALTOR
Ms. Chen, your father's been gone five years.
This house is worth--

SARAH
I know what it's worth.

REALTOR
Two million. And it's falling apart.

SARAH
Then it'll fall apart with me in it.
```

### Variations
- **Interrogation**: Information extracted under pressure
- **Teaching scene**: Mentor reveals to student
- **Argument**: Conflicting goals expose backstory

---

## Subtext Techniques

### When to Use
- Characters hiding true feelings
- Power dynamics in conversation
- Creating layered dialogue

### Structure
- Surface level: What characters SAY
- Subtext level: What characters MEAN
- Action level: What characters DO

### Example
```fountain
INT. KITCHEN - MORNING

Sarah makes coffee. John enters.

JOHN
Sleep well?
(subtext: "Are we okay?")

SARAH
Fine.
(subtext: "We are not okay.")

She doesn't offer him coffee.

JOHN
I could make breakfast.
(subtext: "Let me fix this.")

SARAH
I'm not hungry.
(subtext: "I can't forgive you yet.")

She leaves. He stands alone.
```

### Techniques
- **Denial**: Character says opposite of truth
- **Deflection**: Character changes subject
- **Displacement**: Character talks about something else entirely
- **Physical contradiction**: Actions betray words

---

## Dual Dialogue

### When to Use
- Simultaneous conversations
- Characters talking past each other
- Building comedic or dramatic tension

### Structure
```fountain
CHARACTER A
First character's line

CHARACTER B ^
Second character's simultaneous line
```

### Example
```fountain
INT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT

SARAH
We need to talk about--

JOHN ^
I have something to tell you--

They both stop.

SARAH
You first.

JOHN ^
No, you go.

Beat.

SARAH                          JOHN ^
I want a divorce.              I got promoted.
```

### Variations
- **Cross-purposes**: Characters on different topics
- **Echo**: Characters reach same conclusion
- **Escalation**: Overlapping arguments

---

## Voice Differentiation

### When to Use
- Multiple characters in scene
- Distinguishing similar characters
- Creating memorable voices

### Structure
Define each character's voice through:

| Element | Examples |
|---------|----------|
| Vocabulary | Educated/casual, technical/simple |
| Rhythm | Short/long sentences, interruptions |
| Syntax | Formal/informal, complete/fragments |
| Idioms | Regional, cultural, generational |
| Verbal tics | Pet phrases, filler words |

### Example
```fountain
PROFESSOR WELLS
The implications of your hypothesis are,
shall we say, extraordinary.

DANNY
So it works?

PROFESSOR WELLS
I didn't say that. I said extraordinary.
Not synonymous with functional.

DANNY
But it could work?

PROFESSOR WELLS
(sighing)
You young people and your optimism.
```

### Voice Profile Template
```
CHARACTER NAME:
- Education level: [high school/college/advanced]
- Speech pattern: [formal/casual/technical]
- Sentence length: [short/medium/long]
- Filler words: [um/like/you know/none]
- Signature phrase: [if any]
- Avoids saying: [taboo words/topics]
```
