# Character Patterns

## Character Introduction

### When to Use
- First appearance of major character
- Establishing personality quickly
- Creating memorable entrance

### Structure
1. **Visual hook** - Something distinctive we see
2. **Action hook** - What they're doing reveals who they are
3. **Attitude hook** - How they interact with others

### Example
**Weak Introduction:**
```fountain
SARAH CHEN (35) enters.
```

**Strong Introduction:**
```fountain
INT. OFFICE - DAY

A paper airplane sails across the cubicle farm.

SARAH CHEN (35) catches it without looking up from
her phone. She unfolds it, reads the message, crumples
it, and tosses it into a trash can ten feet away.

Perfect shot.

She finally looks up. Smiles at the sender.

SARAH
Your proposal is rejected.

She goes back to her phone.
```

### Variations
- **In medias res**: Character already in action
- **Contrast**: Character in unexpected environment
- **Reveal**: Hidden then shown
- **Through others**: Described before appearing

## Arc Transformation Moments

### When to Use
- Showing character growth
- Marking internal change
- Payoff for earlier setup

### Structure
| Beat | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Ghost** | Past wound that shapes behavior |
| **Lie** | False belief character holds |
| **Want** | External goal |
| **Need** | Internal growth required |
| **Moment of Truth** | Choice that reveals change |

### Example Arc
```
Ghost: Sarah's father abandoned her at age 8
Lie: "Everyone leaves eventually"
Want: Find out truth about father
Need: Learn to trust again
Moment of Truth: Chooses to trust John despite risk
```

### Key Transformation Scenes

**Before (Setup):**
```fountain
JOHN
You can trust me.

SARAH
I don't trust anyone.
```

**During (Midpoint):**
```fountain
JOHN
You can trust me.

Sarah hesitates. A long beat.

SARAH
Maybe.
```

**After (Climax):**
```fountain
Sarah hands John the evidence.

SARAH
I trust you.

First time she's said those words.
```

## Relationship Dynamics

### When to Use
- Two-character scenes
- Building chemistry (positive or negative)
- Power struggles

### Structure
Define the dynamic through:
- **Status**: Who has power?
- **Want**: What does each want from the other?
- **History**: What's their shared past?
- **Trajectory**: Where is this going?

### Dynamic Types

| Type | Description | Example |
|------|-------------|---------|
| **Push-Pull** | Attraction and resistance | Romance, reluctant allies |
| **One-Up** | Constant power jockeying | Rivals, toxic relationships |
| **Mentor-Student** | Knowledge transfer | Training, coming-of-age |
| **Mirror** | Characters reflect each other | Protagonist-antagonist |
| **Complementary** | Strengths compensate weaknesses | Buddy cops, partners |

### Example: Push-Pull
```fountain
INT. BAR - NIGHT

Sarah and John at a table, drinks between them.

SARAH
I don't like you.

JOHN
You keep saying that.

SARAH
Because you keep showing up.

JOHN
And you keep letting me in.

She doesn't have a comeback for that.

JOHN (CONT'D)
Another round?

SARAH
(beat)
Fine. But this doesn't mean anything.

JOHN
Of course not.

He smiles. She almost smiles back.
```
