## Using Patterns

### Pattern Discovery
Before writing:
1. Identify what type of scene/moment you need
2. Find the relevant pattern file
3. Adapt the structure to your story
4. Maintain your unique voice

### Pattern Adaptation
Patterns are starting points, not rules:
- Combine elements from multiple patterns
- Subvert expectations intentionally
- Let character drive pattern choice

### Creating New Patterns
When you develop effective new approaches:
1. Document the pattern structure
2. Provide clear examples
3. Note when to use/avoid
4. Add to appropriate file
