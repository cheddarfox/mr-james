# Story Structure Patterns

## Three-Act Structure

| Act Three | 90-120 | Resolution - climax, resolution, new equilibrium |

### Key Beats
1. **Opening Image** (p.1) - Tone setter
2. **Inciting Incident** (p.12) - Life-changing event
3. **End of Act One** (p.25-30) - Point of no return
4. **Midpoint** (p.55-60) - Major reversal or revelation
5. **End of Act Two** (p.85-90) - All is lost moment
6. **Climax** (p.100-110) - Final confrontation

Eight sequences of 10-15 pages each:

| B | One | 15-30 | Predicament and lock-in |
| C | Two | 30-45 | First obstacle/complication |
| D | Two | 45-60 | First culmination (midpoint) |
| E | Two | 60-75 | Subplot intensifies |
| F | Two | 75-90 | Main tension escalates |
| G | Three | 90-105 | Second culmination (crisis) |
| H | Three | 105-120 | Resolution |

### Sequence Goals
Each sequence should have:
- Clear beginning, middle, end
- Specific dramatic question
- Resolution that raises new question (except H)

### Example Breakdown
```
Sequence A: Sarah discovers letter in attic
Sequence B: She decides to investigate despite warnings
Sequence C: First clue leads to dead end
Sequence D: She finds her father was a spy (midpoint)
