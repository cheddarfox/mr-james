# Character Dossiers: Three Protagonists

---

## MARCUS ALLEN WATERS

### Basic Info
- **Age:** 10 (1999) / 30 (2019)
- **Background:** Single mom, absent father
- **2019 Occupation:** Healthcare Administrator, Atlanta
- **Archetype:** The Caretaker / Late Learner

### The Wound
Age 8: Mother collapsed from exhaustion. Marcus handled everything - 911, hospital forms, social workers. That night he decided he would never be a burden and would always be the one others could depend on.

### Psychology
- **Lie:** "I must carry everyone's burdens alone. If I stop, everyone falls."
- **Truth:** "Strength is knowing when to let others hold you."
- **Flaw:** Compulsive self-reliance
- **Strength:** Extraordinary competence, genuine care

### What Mr. James Meant
The first adult who saw Marcus as a child, not a little adult. "Sit down, Mars. Let me get you some cocoa."

Mr. James once said: "The strongest people I've ever known weren't the ones who never needed help. They were the ones brave enough to ask for it."

### Minos Symbolism
The labyrinth of indispensability he's built around himself.

### Transformation Moment
Must literally ask for help. Say the words: "I can't do this alone. I need you." And then - receive it.

### Voice (Age 30)
> "I've already booked the hotel, coordinated the schedules, and researched the property. Here's a binder."

> [Transformation] "I don't know what to do. I've tried everything. Can you... help me?"

## DELIA MARIE SANTIAGO

### Basic Info
- **Age:** 10 (1999) / 30 (2019)
- **Background:** Father died suddenly when she was 9
- **2019 Occupation:** Stand-up comedian / bartender, Brooklyn
- **Archetype:** The Ironical (Sarcastic)

### The Wound
Age 9: Last conversation with her father. He held up sea glass she'd found and said, "You see the beauty in broken things. Never lose that." She didn't know those would be his last words.

After his death, she found a box labeled "For Delia when she's older" - his research, a compass, and an unfinished letter: "If you're reading this, I didn't get to tell you..." The rest was blank.

### Psychology
- **Lie:** "I'll never measure up to my father. I'll keep moving so I don't fall into the hole his death left."
- **Truth:** "My life is not a memorial - it's my own story."
- **Flaw:** Uses humor as armor, incapable of stillness or sincerity
- **Strength:** Emotional intelligence she hides, finds light in dark places

### What Mr. James Meant
Mr. James knew her father - they'd collaborated on local history. After Rafael died, Mr. James kept telling stories about him in present tense, as if he still existed.

Mr. James said: "There's a difference between finding light in darkness and running from the dark."

### Minos Symbolism
The long corridors of grief she's been running through, making jokes to echo off the walls.

### Transformation Moment
Words fail her. She cannot make a joke. She stands in silence and begins to cry. Twenty years of unshed tears. Her friends hold her. She doesn't need to be funny. She's just loved.

### Voice (Age 30)
> "Marcus with an itinerary, what a shock. Is there a bar in this hotel? I'm manifesting a bar."

> [Transformation] "I don't have a joke for this. My dad used to bring me here and I just... I miss him. I'm so tired of being funny."

## TERRENCE MICHAEL COLE

### Basic Info
- **Age:** 10 (1999) / 30 (2019)
- **Background:** Military father, emotionally absent
- **2019 Occupation:** Defense contractor, D.C. (former Army Captain)
- **Archetype:** The Authoritarian / Soldier

### The Wound
Age 8: Report card day. Four As and one B+. Father said nothing, left the room, didn't speak to him for three days. Terrence learned: emotion is weakness, control is love, a B+ is failure.

Age 12: Sister Amber left after father said "You've disappointed me for the last time." Father told the family: "We don't discuss her." Terrence learned: love can be revoked entirely.

### Psychology
- **Lie:** "Emotions are weakness. Control is safety. If I feel, I fail."
- **Truth:** "Feeling doesn't make me weak. It makes me human."
- **Flaw:** Emotional suppression, cannot allow vulnerability
- **Strength:** Fierce loyalty, decisive action, protector instinct

### 20-Year Gap
- West Point, Military Intelligence
- Two deployments to Afghanistan
- Lost three team members in 2016 ambush (Silver Star, doesn't display it)
- Married 2014, divorced 2017 ("impossible to reach")
- PTSD diagnosis he rejected
- Left Army 2018 after incident report noted "emotional volatility" (threw a chair)

### What Mr. James Meant
When Terrence knocked something over being reckless, Mr. James said: "Well, that was exciting. Help me pick these up and tell me what you were running from."

Mr. James said: "The bravest soldiers I knew weren't the ones who felt nothing. They were the ones who felt everything and fought anyway."

### Minos Symbolism
The labyrinth of control he built to contain what he thinks is monstrous: emotion, need, grief, rage. The minotaur at the center isn't a monster - it's just a boy who was never allowed to be wild.

### Transformation Moment
The dam breaks. Tells them about his men, his sister, his marriage. Says what he's never said: "I feel everything. I've always felt everything. I just couldn't show it."

His friends don't flinch. Don't leave. Don't revoke their love.

### Voice (Age 30)
> "Acknowledged. I've allocated forty-eight hours. The location is secured. Questions?"

> [Transformation] "I had a team. Three of them trusted me and I couldn't... I don't know how to do this. Talk. Feel. You're the only people who knew me before I became this."

## THREE-CHARACTER CONVERGENCE

| Character | They Give | They Need to Receive | Who Teaches Them |
|-----------|-----------|---------------------|------------------|
| Marcus | Care and organization | Permission to be cared for | Terrence & Delia |
| Delia | Laughter and light | Permission to cry | Marcus & Terrence |
| Terrence | Protection and action | Permission to feel | Marcus & Delia |

### The Treasure
What they find at the end isn't gold or answers about Mr. James.

It's permission.
- Permission for Marcus to rest
- Permission for Delia to grieve
- Permission for Terrence to feel

The treasure is each other. The treasure is what they lost when childhood ended. Mr. James knew. The puzzle was never about the prize - it was about getting three broken adults back into the same room and giving them the labyrinth that would force them to face their minotaurs together.
