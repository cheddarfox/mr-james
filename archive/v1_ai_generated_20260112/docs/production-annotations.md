## 1. VFX/Special Effects Notes

### Compass Needle Movements

The compass is a recurring magical realism element requiring subtle VFX work.

| Scene | Location | Effect Description | Notes |
|-------|----------|-------------------|-------|
| INT. RECREATION CENTER - 1999 | Main Hall | Compass needle spins lazily, then settles pointing at three specific children | Practical compass with CG needle replacement; needle must track to actors |
| INT. THE SANCTUARY - MAIN HALL - EPILOGUE | Main Hall | Compass needle spins, settles, points at new children | Same technique as above |
| EXT. THE SANCTUARY - MAGIC HOUR | Front Porch | Compass needle spins, settles, points straight up at sky | Final image; needle rises vertically |

**VFX Approach Recommendation:**
- Shoot with practical hero compass
- Track compass in-frame
- Replace needle with CG element in post
- Subtle glow enhancement optional for magical realism tone

### Magical Realism Moments

| Scene | Description | VFX Level |
|-------|-------------|-----------|
| Storage Facility - Unit 47 | Three adults freeze in recognition; emphasis on their simultaneous reaction | Editorial timing; no VFX needed |
| Dragon's Gate Bridge | Fog off the river at midnight | Practical fog machine + enhancement in post |
| Cemetery Gravesites | Birdsong emphasis after emotional revelations | Sound design; no VFX |
| Magic Hour Finale | The building glows with sunset light | Timing-dependent cinematography; possible color grade enhancement |

### Time Period Transitions

No visual VFX required for flashback transitions. Use:
- SUPER titles for date/time cards
- Production design changes for period accuracy
- Wardrobe/hair changes for age transitions

## 5. Wardrobe Notes

### Timeline Transition Requirements

The screenplay operates across three time periods with significant wardrobe implications:

1. **1999 Flashbacks** - Children's summer clothes; Mr. James's consistent appearance
2. **Present Day (2020)** - Adult characters showing their psychological states through clothing
3. **Epilogue (6 Months Later)** - Same characters but evolved/healed

---

### Principal Characters - Present Day

#### MARCUS CHEN (30)

**Opening:**
- Hospital scrubs (indicates overwork, came straight from shift)
- Dark circles under eyes (makeup department)

**Throughout:**
- Sensible, practical clothing
- Professional but worn
- Colors: muted, controlled

**Epilogue:**
- More relaxed fit
- Warmer colors
- Still professional but approachable

**Character Arc:** Closed-off doctor to emotionally available leader

---

#### DELIA SANTIAGO (30)

**Opening:**
- Comedy club t-shirt (rumpled)
- Oversized sunglasses (hiding)
- Casual, slightly disheveled

**Brooklyn Apartment:**
- Comfortable home clothes
- Signs of financial stress (worn items)

**Comedy Club Scene:**
- Performance attire
- Still casual but more put-together

**Epilogue:**
- Brighter colors
- Creative expression in clothing
- Confident but not flashy

**Character Arc:** Hiding behind humor to authentic presence

---

#### TERRENCE WILLIAMS (30)

**Opening:**
- Worn army jacket (key character piece)
- Rigid posture
- Practical, military-influenced civilian clothes

**D.C. Apartment:**
- Workout clothes (push-up scene)
- Bare minimum

**Throughout:**
- Maintains army jacket as armor
- Dark, practical colors

**Epilogue:**
- Army jacket may be absent or worn more casually
- Still disciplined but softened
- Compass visible around neck

**Character Arc:** Armored soldier to vulnerable leader

---

#### MR. JAMES WASHINGTON (67 in 1999)

**Consistent throughout all 1999 scenes:**
- Work clothes, clean and pressed
- Dignified despite humble materials
- Gold watch chain (signature accessory)
- Vitiligo patterns visible on skin (makeup)
- White hair

**Note:** Mr. James only appears in 1999 flashbacks. His appearance should convey wisdom, warmth, and careful self-presentation despite modest means.

---

#### MRS. PATTERSON (80s)

- Elegant despite age
- Church-appropriate attire
- Dignified Black woman's style
- Quality accessories (purse)

---

#### HOPE WASHINGTON (28)

- Natural hair
- Practical but stylish
- Young professional on limited budget
- Library-appropriate attire (part-time worker)

---

### Young Cast - 1999 Period Wardrobe

**Critical:** All children's clothing must be period-accurate for 1999. No contemporary logos, styles, or colors that would read as post-2000.

#### YOUNG MARCUS (10)
- Neat, organized appearance
- Hand-me-downs but well-maintained
- "Little adult" energy
- Child taking care of younger sibling

#### YOUNG DELIA (10)
- Pockets for collecting small objects
- Slightly mismatched (grieving household)
- Tall and gangly - clothes may be slightly small
- Bottle caps, marble, shiny objects in pockets

#### YOUNG TERRENCE (10)
- Military child influence
- Practical, durable
- Defensive posture affects fit
- Moving frequently = limited wardrobe

#### Other Children (20)
- Mix of economic backgrounds
- 1999 summer clothes
- Indoor recreation center appropriate
- Sneakers, t-shirts, shorts

---

### Special Wardrobe Considerations

#### Night Shoots
- Bridge scene: Characters need weather-appropriate layers
- Outdoor scenes: Practical for Cleveland weather

#### Emotional Continuity
- Diner through Recreation Center is one continuous day
- Wardrobe must track across these scenes

#### City Council Scene
- Former Sanctuary kids should represent various professions
- Doctor's coat, teacher's attire, firefighter reference, etc.
- Shows diversity of successful outcomes

#### Epilogue Transformations
- All three principals should show subtle but visible evolution
- Colors warmer
- Postures more relaxed (affects costume fit)
- Marcus, Delia, Terrence each have signature item with them (book, mirror, compass)
