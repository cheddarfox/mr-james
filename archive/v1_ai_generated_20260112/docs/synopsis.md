Three adults who shared magical childhood summers reunite twenty years later for one final quest from their dying mentor—and discover the treasure was never the magic. It was each other.

## SYNOPSIS

MARCUS, DELIA, and TERRENCE are strangers at a storage auction in Cleveland until Unit 47 opens, revealing childhood treasures from "The Sanctuary"—the summer program run by MR. JAMES, a man who taught them about labyrinths and minotaurs when they were ten years old. They haven't spoken in twenty years.

A letter from the grave sends them on a quest through Cleveland's landmarks, each location hiding personal messages that expose the "dragons" they've been running from: Marcus, a healthcare admin who collapses from exhaustion because he can't ask for help. Delia, a comedian who uses jokes to outrun the grief of losing her parents. Terrence, a soldier who locked away all feeling after his father taught him emotion equals weakness.

At each stop, flashbacks reveal the summer of 1999—Mr. James seeing these wounded children when no one else did, teaching them that the minotaur isn't the enemy, the labyrinth is. The protective walls we build become our prisons.

At the midpoint, they stand at Mr. James's grave and confront the truth: he died alone because none of them answered his calls. They abandoned the man who saved them.

In the darkness of the condemned Sanctuary, they finally break. Each confesses who they failed to be there for. Marcus says words he's never spoken: "I can't do this alone. I need you both."

Learning the Sanctuary was left to them but faces demolition, they mobilize hundreds of former program kids—now teachers, doctors, parents—for city council testimony. The building is saved unanimously. Six months later, Marcus kneels before new children and asks: "Who here believes in magic?"

The work continues.
