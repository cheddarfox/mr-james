## About This Project

The WTFB Projects Template is pioneering Human-AI team collaboration. Instead of one AI doing everything, we've built a system where 11 specialized AI agents work together — each with their own expertise, responsibilities, and authority.

Learn more in the [README](README.md) or read the [Harness Paper](docs/WTFB-HARNESS-PAPER.md).

## Thank You

Every contribution helps prove that AI can work the way human teams work — with specialists, collaboration, and quality control.

We're grateful for your support.
